Based on these actions and others that are in flight, we believe we have a clear line of sight to a sustainable ROTCE of approximately 15% in the medium term. In order to achieve that, we need to continue to optimize our capital, including returning capital to shareholders and redeploying capital to higher returning businesses; execute on efficiency initiatives; and benefit from the investments we are making in our businesses.",

For certain cohorts of customers, average deposit balances are below pre-pandemic levels, and we are closely monitoring activity for signs of potential stress. For our borrowers, we are working to limit the risk - both to them and to us - of overextension. We have taken selective actions across our consumer lending businesses to mitigate risks associated with inflation and increased debt leverage. In our auto business, we have adjusted policies to address risk associated with collateral value declines and inflationary pressures on consumers' ability to pay. In home lending, we have tightened loan-to-value policies nationally and even more so in local markets that have elevated home value risk. Additionally, in our card business, we have tightened our lending policy to focus on applicants who may be exhibiting debt-seeking behavior.",

Our legal entity structure, extent of international regulatory oversight and physical footprint are far simpler than many of our competitors. Approximately 90% of our revenues come from U.S. clients or activities of non-U.S. clients in the U.S. Our businesses outside the U.S. primarily support our U.S. customer base. We are very happy with our existing footprint and are not looking beyond for growth opportunities. 2. Our products are not complex compared with those offered by other banks and are similar to those offered by smaller institutions. We predominantly provide the same products and services as regional and smaller, more local banks. We take deposits, provide financing, move money, and provide financial advice for our customers. Our trading activities and the size of our market risk are relatively small compared to other large GSIBs. 3. Scale in each of our businesses should not make us more complex. Our distribution methods are similar to smaller institutions. We manage a branch network, have relationship managers across our markets, market through the internet, traditional advertising, direct mail, and word of mouth, and we rely on our local reputation. The controls necessary to manage a network of 4,000+ branches are similar to those necessary to manage a smaller branch network. The same is true for managing relationship managers, marketing, and protecting our reputation. Senior management should be involved at a detailed level, but all institutions should have and rely on defined control frameworks in place that are effective at risk management, regardless of individuals in a seat. These frameworks can effectively scale to a bank of our size. 4. Our customers benefit from our size and reach. Wells Fargo has nearly 4,600 retail bank branches, with a presence in 25 of the largest 30 markets in the U.S. A Wells Fargo branch or ATM is within 2 miles of over half of U.S. Census households and small businesses in our footprint. The range of banking services we provide helps us build full relationships with individuals and companies, allowing us to see a full picture of their personal, family, and/or business financial needs, and to meet these needs. We have the ability to invest in technology to make it faster, safer, and",

We must think about raw numbers, not just percentages which are indexed to a large customer base, asset base, or capital base. We have built functions and processes to review customer complaints, employee allegations, and issues raised from outside the company, and aim to use them to identify issues and themes so we can address them and make changes as required. 2. Don't assume incidents are isolated - One of the advantages large institutions have is the amount of data and information we see and have, but we must use it expeditiously. Individual incidents provide data points which can help us learn and react, and we should treat each as such. We strive to make data-driven decisions and to explore whether incidents that can appear isolated can in fact have broader application elsewhere in the company. 3. Identify weaknesses ourselves and address them quickly - The Acting Comptroller stated that \"the business of banking is operationally intensive. Even at banks with strong teams and robust risk management systems and controls, mistakes and problems can arise. Well-managed banks identify such problems early and often, address them quickly, and take steps to prevent their recurrence.\" We agree completely. Many of the historical issues we continue to work through were identified by regulators, not by us. We are changing this, emphasizing our responsibility to self-identify more issues and address them with a heightened sense of urgency. As we implement our risk and control framework, we will likely identify more issues and move with haste to implement compensating and ultimately permanent controls. Our risk and control framework is not a project, but an ongoing set of actions, and it will be part of our culture. 4. Hubris, contempt, and indifference are unacceptable and dangerous traits - We cannot believe that we know better",

Every issue raised has the opportunity to be a learning moment and we should also proactively look at our competitors to learn as well. Integration of mergers is more than a short-term technology conversion - While we have not had a merger- related systems integration in my time at Wells Fargo, we agree that \"simply stitch[ing]...systems together\" can cause a proliferation of issues. It is critical to merge and simplify platforms, whether merger-related or as part of a customer service strategy, as the reduced complexity in the number of platforms should make it easier to properly serve customers. For example, asking customer-service representatives to learn multiple systems to provide the same information creates more operational risk and the possibility of a poor customer experience. But these platform mergers should be the beginning of integration, not the end. This is true looking both from our perspective and the customer perspective. Customers think of us as one company, not as separate relationships with individual lines of business. They want to see their information seamlessly and be able to transact with us easily across all of their products. Unless we integrate our platforms, we will either not appear as one company to the customer, or we will create workarounds to try and accomplish this, which creates unneeded operational risk. A major competitive advantage of Wells Fargo is serving our customers across a broad range of products, but we can only do so effectively with common platforms. The same is true of data platforms. Pulling customer data from multiple platforms is operationally complex and expensive. Common data platforms across our company are critical. We rely on this for financial reporting, regulatory reporting, risk reporting, and the ability to assess a customer relationship holistically. And finally, it is a mistake to lose sight of aged platforms, to not invest in improving them and to not move to new ones. New software and hardware solutions make it easier to reduce complexity and properly serve customers, and when these solutions are part of a program with a clear target state, they should significantly reduce operational complexity. Recognizing this, Wells Fargo is implementing a modern technology stack that is cloud-native and therefore more elastic and resilient. We are applying this stack for the various product domains that we are modernizing across our businesses. Examples include a more modern digital desktop for our financial advisors in Wealth and Investment Management, our value-at-risk models in Corporate and Investment Banking, and our payment platforms across businesses. These modernization initiatives are guided top-down by a product and platform architecture that sets",

For each consent order Matters Requiring Attention (MRAs), and other control gaps identified, we needed to build detailed plans that satisfied both us and our regulators. Our plans are now detailed and have hundreds of deliverables with designated delivery dates. Many of our consent orders have work that relies on work from another order, so any slippage on one plan can impact another. Our ability to assess all of this accurately for work to be done over multiple years has not been perfect, and we have missed some deliverables, but we have learned, adjusted, and continue to move forward. 4. We needed to build processes to manage these across the company. Building reporting and setting up management review structures for these activities has been critical to moving the work forward. Most of these did not exist or were ineffective, and we now believe we have much more effective reporting and processes in place to provide appropriate oversight and allow us to identify issues early so we can course-correct. 5. We did not have the resources necessary to accomplish this work when I arrived. We have added close to 10,000 people across numerous risk- and control-related groups and have spent approximately $2 billion more in 2022 than in 2018 in these areas. We are committed to make the investments needed to complete the work. 6. And we had to build the management disciplines and culture to govern and execute such a large body of work. Our Operating Committee reviews risk and regulatory progress and escalations on a weekly basis. We provide detailed reporting to the full board and appropriate committees so they can provide oversight. These reviews are systematic and detailed, and they are helping us provide the appropriate oversight and involvement to accomplish the work.",

As part of this shift, we announced our plans to exit the Correspondent business, reduce the size of our Servicing portfolio, and optimize our Retail team so it aligns with our narrower customer focus. These actions will allow us to reduce risk in the Home Lending business while continuing making homeownership possible to thousands of Americans. Over the past year, we have taken several additional steps to simplify the way we operate. For instance, we have: * Implemented a cloud-native operating model which will enable us to reduce reliance on older, less stable platforms and allows us to innovate faster * Centrally organized our Control Management teams, to enable better coordination across our businesses * Streamlined our divisional leadership in Wells Fargo Advisors, moving from eight regional divisions to four * Combined Treasury Services platforms across Commercial Banking and Corporate and Investment Banking Looking further back to 2021, 2020, and 2019, we have: * Sold Wells Fargo Asset Management * Sold our Corporate Trust Services business * Sold our student lending portfolio and stopped the origination of new student loans * Exited our international wealth management segment * Sold our Canadian direct equipment finance business",

Providing such digitized services directly to our customers reduces operational complexity in our service centers and increases customer satisfaction. * We continued to improve our credit card offerings including launching two new cards - Wells Fargo Autograph and BILT. While we describe these as new products, these are actually updated products in a business we have been in for many years. * We launched Wells Fargo Premier, our new offering dedicated to the financial needs of affluent clients by bringing together our branch-based and wealth-based businesses to provide a more comprehensive, relevant, and integrated offering for our clients. * We also relaunched Intuitive Investor in our Wealth and Investment Management segment, making it easier for customers to invest with a streamlined account opening process and a lower minimum investment.",

As required by the consent orders, the Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company's internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management of remediation activities conducted by the Company. The Company continues to work to address the provisions of the consent orders. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC's April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the Company's Home Lending business. On December 20, 2022, the CFPB modified its consent order to clarify how it would terminate.",

On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority and ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced that certain settings of LIBOR would no longer be published on a representative basis after December 31, 2021, and the most commonly used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings would no longer be published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. Central banks in various jurisdictions convened committees to identify replacement rates to facilitate the transition away from LIBOR. The committee convened by the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the replacement rate for USD LIBOR. In first quarter 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the LIBOR Act) was enacted into U.S. federal law to provide a statutory framework to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on SOFR in U.S. law contracts that do not have fallback provisions or that have fallback provisions resulting in a replacement rate based on LIBOR. The FRB adopted a final rule implementing the LIBOR Act on December 16, 2022, which will become effective on February 27, 2023. We expect that the LIBOR Act will transition certain of our legacy USD LIBOR contracts that do not have appropriate fallback provisions to the applicable SOFR-based replacement rates specified in the FRB's final rule.",

Represents Wells Fargo net income applicable to common stock divided by average common stockholders' equity. Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights) and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it enables management, investors, and others to assess the Company's use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures, see the \"Capital Management - Tangible Common Equity\" section in this Report. The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). See the \"Capital Management\" section and Note 25 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information. Represents TLAC divided by risk-weighted assets (RWAs), which is our binding TLAC ratio, determined by using the greater of RWAs under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. Represents average high-quality liquid assets divided by average projected net cash outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule. Dividend payout ratio is dividends declared per common share as a percentage of diluted earnings per common share. Book value per common share is common stockholders' equity divided by common shares outstanding.",
