      "Our company adopted Responsible Growth in 2014, and fully discussed its core tenets in our Annual Report the following year. These tenets have served as the foundation for our strong performance and progress.\n",
      "We have seen Responsible Growth work in the relative calm of 2015 to 2019, the pandemic tumult of 2020 and 2021, and the inﬂationary period of 2022. In each of these periods, our company beneﬁted from our long-term consistency and adherence to the tenets of Responsible Growth.\n",
      "Responsible Growth has served us well under varied conditions The core tenets of Responsible Growth have served our company and you, our shareholders, well during good times and stress.\n",
      "Responsible Growth served us well through the period from 2015 to 2019, when the economies of the world settled into normalized growth rates and interest rates rose in the U.S. with the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle.\n",
      "As the pandemic hit in early 2020, a major economic crisis ensued and your company performed well once again, even as we met our clients’ borrowing demands, built reserves, traded through uncertain markets, and helped our employees, clients and our communities deal with the pandemic and its aftermath. Again, Responsible Growth served us well.\n",
      "During 2022, the U.S. and the world continued to face civil tensions from the pandemic and lockdowns, social and racial conﬂicts, a war in Europe and energy supply disruptions, and inﬂation.\n",
      "Responsible Growth\n",
      "Win in the market, no excuses. 1. Grow with a customer-focused strategy. 2. Grow with the right risk principles. 3. Grow in a sustainable manner: Be the best place to work, share our success with our communities and drive Operational Excellence. 4.\n",
      "The strength of our balance sheet, risk management, organic growth, and expense management became a catalyst that drove our ﬁnancial performance.\n",
      "Let’s take a look at highlights of our performance in each of these periods, beginning with 2015 to 2019 as the U.S. economy set a record for one of the longest periods of economic growth. The Federal Reserve started a tightening cycle in 2016, raising interest rates reﬂecting the strength of the U.S. economy. Here’s how we did:\n",

      "Then came the pandemic, which brought with it 15% U.S. unemployment, a 30% drop in U.S. GDP annualized growth rate, huge fiscal stimuli, supply chain disruptions, and an instantaneous drop to 0% rates. After the recovery was assured by early 2021, a period of inflation set in resulting in the steepest interest rate increase path we have seen in the U.S. in the past 40 years.

      "As a side note, the total cumulative charge-oﬀs at Bank of America from 2015 to 2022, reﬂecting Responsible Growth, were less than the charge-oﬀs recorded in the single year 2010 despite a recession, a pandemic, unprecedented monetary policy changes, and war occurring in these years.\n",

      "We are positioned well for the future. In the post-pandemic period we have reestablished our organic growth engine.\n",
      "For the entirety of the period from 2015 to 2022, we have seen the stock price double; we have produced $185 billion in after-tax earnings; and we have invested heavily in our franchise to better serve our customers and clients. Responsible Growth worked in all those environments and produced strong results on an enormous scale.\n",
      "A simple way to think about this is only four U.S. companies have earned more than $15 billion in GAAP after-tax income in each of these eight years. Your company is one of them.\n",
      "More importantly, we are positioned well for the future. In the post-pandemic period we have reestablished our organic growth engine. We have delivered revenue growth, while controlling expense, in a highly volatile environment. You will note increased costs for 2019 to 2022 above. First, we had cost increases for special pandemic programs and to take care of our team. Then, inﬂation added to costs. But in the end, we have just delivered our sixth straight quarter of operating leverage in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n",
      "We have strong credit quality, capital ratios in excess of constantly increased regulatory minimums, a highly-respected brand, high employee satisfaction and loyalty, and incredible customers we are honored to serve. We have built and improved upon digital capabilities across every line of business to serve these customers, which embed the most eﬀective capabilities of a ﬁntech into the strength and stability of a well-regulated company.\n",
      "While we review and learn from the past, we don’t live there. What we are excited about is how our proven operating model sets us up for the future. Our team relishes the work ahead to continue to deliver for you. So, as we look forward to the years ahead, we are poised to continue to drive Responsible Growth, no matter what comes at us.\n",

You will see more about these leaders on pages 12 and 13.\n",
      "I especially want to recognize Lead Independent Director Lionel Nowell, who was named as “Independent Director of the Year” by Corporate Board Member magazine. Lionel shares his perspective on our company on page 11.\n",
      "We welcomed José (Joe) E. Almeida, who joined your Board in September. We also give our appreciation to David Yost, a director since 2012, who is retiring due to age guidelines and will not stand for reelection at our annual shareholders’ meeting. We thank Dave for his leadership, oversight, and prudent stewardship.\n",
      "Thank you as well to my 217,000 teammates who join me every day at our company to fulﬁll our purpose of making ﬁnancial lives better. In a year that began with many of us once again working from home, we are pleased to have our teammates back together, collaborating in person to serve our clients and deliver the full breadth of our capabilities, as you’ll see highlighted throughout this Annual Report.\n",
      "This followed a strong 2021 performance that saw our stock outperform and increase 47%. Book value per share and tangible book value per share both increased in 2022.\n",
      "We also addressed increased regulatory changes in our capital requirements. Our common equity tier 1 capital (CET1) grew 5% in 2022 to more than $180 billion, and our CET1 ratio of 11.2% remained well above our new minimum requirements. Even while growing capital, our common dividend per share increased 10% from 2021 and, in the aggregate, in 2022 we returned $13.6 billion in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our ﬁrst use of our capital generation is to grow our company by supporting our customers’ needs and pay our dividend. But in the end, we end up with more than we need for those purposes. Share repurchases allow long-term holders to own more of our company.\n",
      "In addition, we continued investments to enhance being a Great Place to Work for teammates. We established a multi-faceted approach to workplace ﬂexibility, provided free lunch for several months to help employees create informal connections and welcome them back fully to work, and continued our competitive pay packages to reward our employees for serving our clients and targeted our eﬀorts at building long careers at Bank of America.\n",
      "A deeper look at 2022 In 2022, we earned $27.5 billion after-tax, a decline from our record-level earnings in 2021, primarily due to increases in credit costs due to the absence of reserve releases. We earned $3.19 per diluted share, on $95 billion in revenue. Our pre-tax, pre-provision income, which adjusts for the provision expense, was up 14%* from 2021, driven by organic growth across our lines of business, higher interest rates, and prudent management of expenses. This helped us achieve operating leverage in 2022.\n",
      "Total assets declined slightly to $3.05 trillion driven by a decrease in deposits due to withdrawal of monetary accommodation. These deposits remain at a healthy $1.9 trillion level. Deposits in the banking industry are shrinking, the natural and intended outcome of the Federal Reserve’s monetary actions to ﬁght inﬂation.\n",
      "For our communities and the broader needs of society, we also remain attentive to areas where we can direct the talent, innovation, and resources of our company and its role in capitalism. For example, we are working alongside our clients toward a clean energy, sustainable future. This is also why we invest in partners and programs in our local markets: to help create economic opportunity and prosperity in underserved communities where the needs can be greatest.\n",
      "Euromoney named Bank of America the World’s Best Bank for the second time in ﬁve years. We’re also pleased to be named America’s most “JUST” Company by JUST Capital.\n",
      "At the same time, even as the economy weakened during 2022, loan demand increased as loans grew $67 billion to more than $1.04 trillion. Asset quality remained strong as net charge-oﬀs remained near the historically low range experienced in 2021.\n",
      "Overall, our balance sheet continued to be supported by high levels of capital and liquidity, enabling us to continue to grow our business with customers, while meeting additional regulatory requirements, and repurchasing shares.\n",
      "For all of this and more, Euromoney named Bank of America the World’s Best Bank for the second time in ﬁve years. In announcing this prestigious ranking, the publication stated: “In an increasingly volatile and uncertain environment, Euromoney recognized Bank of America’s performance not only in retail banking, loan growth, capital markets trading and wealth management, but also its behavior as a corporate citizen.”\n",
      "Rising inﬂation also took its toll on the equities market. For the year, our stock price decreased 24%, directionally in line with the S&P 500 and the broader bank index.\n",
      "We’re also pleased to be named as America’s Most “JUST” Company by JUST Capital. This ranking evaluates how companies invest in employees, communities, and customers, along with other issues JUST Capital has identiﬁed as important to Americans today.\n",
      "We once again delivered both proﬁts and purpose — the genius of the AND as we call it — and we did it by delivering on the tenets of Responsible Growth.\n",
      "I am proud of all that your company, and our team, achieved in 2022. We once again delivered both proﬁts and purpose — the genius of the AND as we call it — and we did it by delivering on the tenets of Responsible Growth. Throughout this letter, I will share with you examples about how we executed against each. The rest of this report discusses that work in greater detail, and we also make available a clear set of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial disclosures so you can see for yourself how we measure our progress and determine where we have more work to do.\n",
      "Throughout this report we provide details about how we do this: How we help transmit the economy by lending, investing, and working alongside our clients to help them succeed. About all we do to support our teammates and be a Great Place to Work for them. The many ways we partner in local markets to help support community priorities. And, at the same time, How we deliver for you, our shareholders.\n",
      "We are capitalists at Bank of America At the core of the progress is our conviction that capitalism is embedded in how Responsible Growth delivers opportunity for our clients, our teammates, the communities we serve, and for you, our shareholders. I’ve sometimes been surprised to be asked — including at Congressional hearings — “Are you a capitalist?” Your company is one of the most proﬁtable companies in the world, whose purpose is to help our customers and clients live their ﬁnancial lives, eﬀectively helping them beneﬁt in the capitalist system. Therefore, you might also ﬁnd the question unusual. Of course, I answered, “Yes.”\n",
      "All these activities reﬂect our view that capitalism creates opportunity — for our customers and clients at every stage of their progress; for our teammates to advance their careers at Bank of America and support their families; for those in our local communities who may need help accessing our economic system to achieve their own goals; and for our millions of investors, a chance to share in our success through their ownership.\n",
      "But I understand the thoughts behind the question. I think the questions and the concerns some may have about capitalism are about opportunity. About whether companies are sharing proﬁts or paying people fairly and equitably. At Bank of America, we look at it in this straightforward way: How can we rely on and help the innovation and energy of capitalism to address the priorities of our communities and society AND beneﬁt our shareholders? Capitalism provides the money, the creativity, and the expertise to solve the needs of society. We enable our customers to drive capitalism. It is what we do.\n",
      "To do this, we align our day-to-day business activities to the work. We bring our $3 trillion balance sheet to the task. We bring our $273 billion in equity. We bring our capital markets and lending capabilities, raising trillions for our clients. We bring the invested assets of our wealth management clients. Of course, we also bring the nearly $360 million of philanthropy we commit. That is how we think of it: capitalism creates opportunity and prosperity, addressing important societal challenges along the way. And we measure our success. See below for how we measure.\n",

That sum is up from 2021 and is expected to be higher again in 2023. And through continuous investment we have spent more than $30 billion over the past decade on new technology initiatives.\n",
      "At the same time, we also continued to focus on delivering expert support and guidance across our high-touch physical network, opening 58 new ﬁnancial centers, and renovating 784 more in 2022. We ended the year with 3,900 ﬁnancial centers and 15,500 ATMs. This network also includes our phone, oﬃces, and chat capabilities. We are pleased by the results in our new markets, where we are growing from no ﬁnancial centers there to become top 10 or above in deposit market share in just a few years.\n",
      "Together, our combined high-tech and high-touch approach to serving clients has led to record-high levels of customer satisfaction for Bank of America in 2022 and, in turn, contributed to our growth. Simply put, more satisﬁed clients do more business with us.\n",
      "This work beneﬁtted from the important insights and guidance from our National Community Advisory Council (NCAC), a group of external advisors, analysts, and consumer advocates that we established 17 years ago. The NCAC provides important external perspective to help us understand, design, and deliver products to help meet the needs of our communities — particularly those in the low- to moderate-income sphere.\n",
      "Grow within our risk framework. The third tenet of Responsible Growth is to grow within our well-managed risk framework — a framework that allowed us to be a source of strength to clients during the health crisis and that has continued to allow us to grow during the current volatile market environment.\n",
      "Another recent example of our customer-focus is the continued evolution of our overdraft services and solutions —work that had been underway for more than a dozen years to reduce clients’ reliance on overdrafts and provide alternatives to help clients manage their deposit accounts and avoid fees. You can see in our Retail Banking update on page 16 that these fees are down over 90% from 2009.\n",
      "Our discipline around risk has us well-prepared for a severe economic stress scenario, as illustrated by Bank of America having the lowest stressed credit loss rates among major banks in nine out of the past 10 CCAR exams conducted by the Federal Reserve Board. As we cited earlier, credit quality continues to be better than 2019, which was the last year before the pandemic and represented a very strong year for credit at banks.\n",
      "We believe that these fees are not sustainable for a good customer relationship, and by eliminating them we are able to increase satisfaction and deepen relationships to create a more stable source of revenues, while reducing costs for our company.\n",
      "In addition to being eﬀective, our risk management is also agile — when regulatory capital ratio requirements for banks changed with little advance notice in 2022, we made moves so that we had a buﬀer to those requirements quickly. Importantly, we did that as we continued to support clients, return capital to shareholders, and strengthen our strong balance sheet.\n",

      "Grow in a sustainable manner. Responsible Growth requires us to grow in a sustainable manner. This has three components.\n",
      "First, we drive Operational Excellence (OpEx). This allows us to create savings, which we can then reinvest — in our capabilities, our teammates, our communities and in capital returns to shareholders. Second, we want to be a Great Place to Work for our teammates. This provides us a competitive edge to attract the best new teammates to serve our clients and retain them once they’ve joined the team. Third, we share our success so we can support the communities in which we work and live and help to address the biggest challenges facing communities today.\n",
      "Driving Operational Excellence. OpEx is how we create the means to reduce costs by striving to eliminate ineﬃciencies in our processes across our platform and reinvest savings into the things that are important to us: our team, our capabilities, our client experience, our communities, and our shareholders.\n",
      "By pursuing OpEx, we drive continuous improvement, reduce risk, and identify faster, simpler, and more eﬃcient ways of working and serving our clients.\n",
      "In 2022, our fourth quarter operating leverage was 6%. Simply put, operating leverage is the percentage growth in revenue minus the percent growth in expenses. By looking for continuous process improvements and savings through OpEx, we have delivered operating leverage for the past six consecutive quarters — picking back up on the 18-quarter streak we had developed prior to the pandemic-driven economic slowdown.\n",
      "In Retail Banking, OpEx and a more digitized customer base helped pay for investments that allowed us to improve that business’s eﬃciency ratio to 47% in the most recent quarter, an impressive 600 basis point improvement over the year-ago fourth quarter.\n",
      "Across the company, we have implemented more than 12,000 employee-sourced suggestions since 2014 to simplify our work and create greater eﬃciency. In addition to making it easier to serve our clients, these ideas have resulted in nearly $5 billion in expense savings and 13 million hours of capacity saved. Whatever challenges the future may hold, your company’s focus on OpEx will help deliver for clients while investing in the future of our people, communities and driving great returns to you, our shareholders. In 2022, our expenses were $61 billion, which is more than $10 billion lower than a decade ago.\n",

This means that any employee who works full-time for our company makes at least ~$46,000 per year as well as some of the most comprehensive beneﬁts available. • In addition to normal merit, we delivered a mid-year increase to annual base salaries for all U.S. employees who currently receive annual total compensation below $100,000 and have been employed with the company since 2021 or earlier. The percentage increase for eligible employees ranged from 3% to 7%, increasing with years of service. • In recognition of the important achievements made by our employees in 2022, our Management Team, Board of Directors and I once again recognized teammates with our Sharing Success compensation award. This is the sixth time teammates will receive this award, totaling more than $4 billion since its inception. Approximately 96% of our teammates received an award this year, with the vast majority receiving it in the form of Bank of America stock to help them share in our long-term success. • We also launched a new sabbatical program for employees celebrating milestones of 15 years or more beginning in 2023, and doubled the number of conﬁdential, face-to-face counseling sessions available through our Employee Assistance Program. • We increased our childcare beneﬁts, which provide eligible employees making less than $100,000 per year a reimbursement of up to $275 a month per child for the cost of childcare. • We also continued to have no, or below our cost, increases in health beneﬁts for most of our teammates to help them care for their families.\n",

      "In 2022, we made nearly $360 million in philanthropic investments to strengthen our communities. Our teammates also donated money, as well as their time, to share success. Charitable giving by our teammates in 2022, combined with matching gifts from Bank of America, totaled more than $65 million. Our teammates also reported nearly two million volunteer hours for the year. | am proud to share this proof of their commitment to our communities with you.\n",
      "To help support health and safety, and address food insecurity in our local markets, we ran two campaigns to encourage employees to get vaccinated and/or boosted against COVID-19 and the ﬂu, donating to hunger relief organizations for each employee who took those actions. Combined, the campaigns donated more than $18 million for hunger organizations across the country. Since 2015 we have donated nearly $184 million toward hunger relief eﬀorts.\n",
      "We also create opportunity in our communities through employment. We are in our second commitment to hire 10,000 teammates from low- and moderate-income communities, having completed the ﬁrst in three years versus the ﬁve pledged. Similarly, to recognize our service men and women, we have hired over 15,000 veterans in the last eight years. We work with other companies to expand the principles of skills-based hiring to large companies. This gives an employee a great start with great beneﬁts.\n",
      "We continue to help drive sustainability through our work with clients to help them transition to a secure, low-carbon economy. We are committed to helping facilitate that just energy transition, with clean energy that is aﬀordable, sustainable and secure. That’s why in 2020 we set a goal to mobilize and deploy $1.5 trillion by 2030 to advance the sustainable development goals (SDGs) 193 countries agreed to in 2015, with $1 trillion of that focused on helping our clients transition to a low-carbon future. From 2021 through 2022, we mobilized and deployed a cumulative total of $410 billion in sustainable ﬁnance, with more than $235 billion of that focused on helping drive aﬀordable clean energy and related priorities. At the same time, we are helping catalyze eﬀorts globally by playing a lead role in multiple global organizations to give private companies from all sectors the opportunity to exchange ideas and consider transactions and investments that can help accelerate the transition.\n",

      "Over the last few years, we have invested in 23 minority depository institutions. We also have helped seed more than 130 private equity funds run by women and diverse private equity entrepreneurs. These private equity funds have funded more than 1,000 operating companies owned by like cohorts. We also recognize the value to our business — and to society — of supply chain diversity. In 2022, approximately $2 billion of our nearly $19 billion in annual spend was with diverse suppliers. You can read more about how we are investing in diverse entrepreneurs on page 36.\n",
      "Measuring our positive impact at home and around the world — how capitalism delivers | was asked by a teammate with a college-age daughter how we might be more convincing that capitalism is doing what society wants from it. My response: We don't leave it to interpretation, we disclose what we do for all to see. What we show in the metrics in this report is the progress we are making as well as the alignment to what society wants from capitalism — to produce profits and purpose. That perpetual motion machine of capitalism can continuously invest in progress on the goals described below. Charity is wonderful, but it doesn't provide enough money. Governments are large spenders, but they are short on cash and run huge deficits, so they really don’t have the money to drive sustained progress. Government policies shift and therefore long-term change is hard to achieve. Companies around the world, when aligned to the tasks generate activity that dwarfs the efforts of other sectors. It is sustained by the profits, which draw more capital. So the straightforward answer to the teammate was — if we want to be successful at what society wants, we should all cheer capitalism on.\n",
      "However, it is important to measure progress to prove capitalism is working. In the U.S. and globally, companies can track their performance in areas that include equality of opportunity, aﬀordable housing, prosperity, access to clean water, sustainable, clean, secure energy, and other priorities.\n",

      "More than 170,000 teammates shared ideas and feedback by participating in our 2022 survey. Our Employee Engagement Index score reﬂects a strong trend over time — increasing 10 percentage points during the last decade. We also measure an internal Diversity & Inclusion Index1 that gives us feedback on how we measure inclusion at the company. It is up 8 percentage points during the same time, and index scores are strong relative to industry benchmarks over time.\n",
      "Over the past decade, our turnover rate has been among the lowest in the industry. In that time, we have experienced vastly diﬀerent labor markets, the pandemic and return to oﬃce. With the tight labor market in 2022, we saw a slight increase in turnover in the ﬁrst half of the year, and in the second half dropped back to pre-pandemic record lows, resulting in a 13% annualized turnover rate — a strong result for a company of our size and scale.\n",
      "The results of the survey and the process of continuous improvement that ensues is discussed with the Board at least annually. Our eﬀorts reﬂect our progress in being a great place to work. We believe our employee turnover reﬂects the strength of our employee engagement results and how our teammates view Bank of America as an employer of choice.\n",
      "With our variety of resources and programs that support career growth and development, we’re helping teammates have long- term careers with our company. We also continue to enhance our internal mobility practices, which has led to nearly 45% of our open roles being ﬁlled by internal candidates.\n",

IBC Purpose-led management: How the company’s stated purpose is embedded in company strategies, policies, and goals. Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures Merrill Lynch and Merrill Private Wealth Management clients enrolled in our investment advisory programs directly determine how to vote their proxies. Through our investment advisory agreement, clients may delegate proxy voting authority directly to institutional shareholder services (ISS) or elect to vote proxies themselves. As part of delegating to ISS, clients may, at their discretion, choose among the ISS Benchmark, ISS Socially Responsible Investing, and ISS Catholic proxy voting guidelines. Managed Account Advisors (MAA) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith (MLPF&S) perform due diligence on ISS to determine that it has the capacity and competency to adequately analyze proxy issues and can make such voting recommendations in an impartial manner and in the best interests of clients. For matters over which ISS has a conﬂict or is otherwise unable to vote (called Speciﬁed Investments), the proxy committee of MAA or MLPF&S, as applicable, will have the authority to vote proxies in accordance with its proxy voting policies and procedures. MAA or MLPF&S does not assume proxy voting authority for securities except with respect to Speciﬁed Investments. For proxies neither covered by ISS nor included as Speciﬁed Investments, the client will retain the right to vote those proxies. Generally, Bank of America The Private Bank (The Private Bank) clients delegate authority to The Private Bank to vote proxies on their behalf. The Private Bank has a ﬁduciary focused proxy voting policy and custom guidelines and employs Glass Lewis to execute the votes. For investment management accounts where The Private Bank is not the trustee or other named ﬁduciary, clients may delegate proxy authority directly to Glass Lewis (or other proxy advisor as determined by The Private Bank) via their investment advisory agreement, as described above.

      "With respect to the transition of LIBOR products referencing USD LIBOR settings ceasing or becoming non-representative as of June 30, 2023, a significant majority of the Corporation's notional contractual exposure to such LIBOR settings, of which the significant majority is derivatives contracts, have been remediated (i.e., updated to include fallback provisions to ARRs based on market-driven protocols, regulatory guidance and industry-recommended fallback provisions and _ related mechanisms), and the Corporation is continuing to remediate the remaining USD LIBOR exposure. For example, during the first half of 2023, certain central counterparties (CCPs) expect to complete processes to convert outstanding USD LIBOR- cleared derivatives to ARR positions. The remaining exposure, a majority of which is made up of derivatives and commercial loans and which represents a small minority of outstanding USD LIBOR notional contractual exposure of the Corporation, requires active dialogue with clients to modify the contracts. For any residual exposures after June 2023 that continue to have no fallback provisions, the Corporation continues to assess and plans to leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions, including the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act in the U.S. (as implemented by the Federal Reserve) and “synthetic” USD LIBOR (if the FCA compels such publication), to transition such exposure.\n",
      "While there remain risks to the Corporation associated with the transition from IBORs (as discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K), such risks have been monitored and, where applicable, managed through the Corporation’s efforts and dedicated operational resources to date. In the Corporation’s view, the potential likelihood and/or impact of transition-related risks has lessened over time, and the Corporation anticipates it has devoted appropriate resources to remaining transition efforts and will be able to continue to appropriately monitor and manage such risks as the transition process continues. The Corporation expects transition-related risks to further diminish as certain market developments occur prior to June 30, 2023.\n",
      "The Corporation has implemented regulatory, tax and accounting changes and continues to monitor current and potential impacts of the transition, including Internal Revenue Service tax regulations and guidance and Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance. In addition, the Corporation has engaged impacted clients in connection with the transition by providing education on ARRs and the timing of transition events. The Corporation is also working actively with global regulators, industry working groups and trade associations.\n",

If not managed well, risk can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the ERC and the Board.\n",

Market risk is composed of price risk and interest rate risk. e Liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. e Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the Corporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations and our internal policies and procedures. e Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, people or external events. e Reputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the Corporation may adversely impact profitability or operations.\n",
      "The following sections address in more detail the specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk. This discussion of managing risk focuses on the current Risk Framework that, as part of its annual review process, was approved by the ERC and the Board.\n",
      "As set forth in our Risk Framework, a culture of managing risk well is fundamental to our values and our purpose, and how we drive Responsible Growth. It requires us to focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management and promote sound risk-taking within our risk appetite. Sustaining a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization is critical to the success of the Corporation and is a clear expectation of our executive management team and the Board.\n",
      "Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth roles and responsibilities for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities.\n",
      "Executive management assesses, with Board oversight, the risk-adjusted returns of each business. Management reviews and approves the strategic and financial operating plans, as well as the capital plan and Risk Appetite Statement, and recommends them annually to the Board for approval. Our strategic plan takes into consideration return objectives and financial resources, which must align with risk capacity and risk appetite. Management sets financial objectives for each business by allocating capital and setting a target for return on capital for each business. Capital allocations and operating limits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall governance processes as the businesses and the economic environment in which we operate continue to evolve. For more information regarding capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations on page 84.\n",
      "The Corporation’s risk appetite indicates the amount of capital, earnings or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans, consistent with applicable regulatory requirements. Our risk appetite provides a common framework that includes a set of measures to assist senior management and the Board in assessing the Corporation’s risk profile against our risk appetite and risk capacity. Our risk appetite is formally articulated in the Risk Appetite Statement, which includes both qualitative statements and quantitative limits.\n",
      "Our overall capacity to take risk is limited; therefore, we prioritize the risks we take in order to maintain a strong and flexible financial position so we can withstand challenging economic conditions and take advantage of organic growth opportunities. Therefore, we set objectives and targets for capital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to operate in a safe and sound manner at all times, including during periods of stress.\n",
      "Our lines of business operate with risk limits that align with the Corporation’s risk appetite. Senior management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to risk appetite limits. The Board, and its committees when appropriate, oversee financial performance, execution of the strategic and financial operating plans, adherence to risk appetite limits and the adequacy of internal controls.\n",
      "For a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities, see the discussion below and pages 96 through 129.\n",
      "Risk Management Governance The Risk Framework describes delegations of authority whereby the Board and its committees may delegate authority to management-level committees or executive officers. Such delegations may authorize certain decision-making and approval functions, which may be evidenced in documents such as committee charters, job descriptions, meeting minutes and resolutions.\n",

The Board authorizes management to maintain an effective Risk Framework and oversees compliance with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, the Board or its committees conduct inquiries of, and receive reports from senior management on, risk-related matters to assess scope or resource limitations that could impede the ability of Global Risk Management (GRM) and/or Corporate Audit to execute its responsibilities. The Board committees discussed below have the principal responsibility for enterprise-wide oversight of our risk management activities. Through these activities, the Board and applicable committees are provided with information on our risk profile and oversee senior management addressing key risks we face. Other Board committees, as described below, provide additional oversight of specific risks.\n",
      "Each of the committees shown on the above chart regularly reports to the Board on risk-related matters within the committee’s responsibilities, which is intended to collectively provide the Board with integrated insight about our management of enterprise-wide risks.\n",

The Audit Committee is also responsible for overseeing compliance risks pursuant to the New York Stock Exchange listing standards.\n",
      "Enterprise Risk Committee The ERC oversees the Corporation’s Risk Framework, risk appetite and senior management’s responsibilities for the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of key risks facing the Corporation. The ERC may consult with other Board committees on risk-related matters.\n",
      "Other Board Committees Our Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee oversees our Board’s governance processes, identifies and reviews the qualifications of potential Board members, leads\n",

      "Management Committees Management committees receive their authority from the Board, a Board committee, or another management committee. Our primary management risk committee is the MRC. Subject to Board oversight, the MRC is responsible for management oversight of key risks facing the Corporation, including an integrated evaluation of risk, earnings, capital and liquidity.\n",
      "Lines of Defense We have clear ownership and accountability for managing risk across three lines of defense: Front Line Units (FLUs), GRM and Corporate Audit. We also have control functions outside of FLUs and GRM (e.g., Legal and Global Human Resources). The three lines of defense are integrated into our management-level governance structure. Each of these functional roles is further described in this section.\n",
      "Executive Officers Executive officers lead various functions representing the functional roles. Authority for functional roles may be delegated to executive officers from the Board, Board committees or management-level committees. Executive officers, in turn, may further delegate responsibilities, as appropriate, to management-level committees, management routines or individuals. Executive officers review our activities for consistency with our Risk Framework, risk appetite, and applicable strategic, capital and financial operating plans, as well as applicable policies and standards. Executive officers and other employees make decisions individually on a day-to-day basis, consistent with the authority they have been delegated. Executive officers and other employees may also serve on committees and participate in committee decisions.\n",
      "Front Line Units FLUs, which include the lines of business as well as Global Technology and Global Operations, are responsible for appropriately assessing and effectively managing all of the risks associated with their activities.\n",
      "Three organizational units that include FLU activities and control function activities, but are not part of GRM are first, the Chief Financial Officer Group; second, the Chief Administrative Officer Group; and third, Global Strategy and Enterprise Platforms.\n",
      "Global Risk Management GRM is part of our control functions and operates as our independent risk management function. GRM, led by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), is responsible for independently assessing and overseeing risks within FLUs and other control functions. GRM establishes written enterprise policies and procedures outlining how aggregate risks are identified, measured, monitored and controlled.\n",
      "The CRO has the stature, authority and independence needed to develop and implement a meaningful risk management framework and practices to guide the Corporation in managing risk. The CRO has unrestricted access to the Board and reports directly to both the ERC and the CEO. GRM is organized into horizontal risk teams that cover a specific risk area and vertical CRO teams that cover a particular FLU or control function. These teams work collaboratively in executing their respective duties.\n",
      "Corporate Audit Corporate Audit and the CAE maintain their independence from the FLUs, GRM and other control functions by reporting directly to the Audit Committee. The CAE administratively reports to the CEO. Corporate Audit provides independent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and controls across the Corporation. Corporate Audit includes Credit Review, which provides an independent assessment of credit lending decisions and the effectiveness of credit processes across the Corporation’s credit platform through examinations and monitoring.\n",
      "Risk Management Processes The Risk Framework requires that strong risk management practices are integrated in key strategic, capital and financial planning processes and in day-to-day business processes across the Corporation, thereby ensuring risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner. We employ an effective risk management process, referred to as Identify, Measure, Monitor and Control, as part of our daily activities.\n",
      "Identify — To be effectively managed, risks must be proactively identified and well understood. Proper risk identification focuses on recognizing and understanding key risks inherent in our business activities or key risks that may arise from external factors. Each employee is expected to identify and escalate risks promptly. Risk identification is an ongoing process that incorporates input from FLUs and _ control functions. It is designed to be forward-looking and to capture relevant risk factors across all of our lines of business. Measure — Once a risk is identified, it must be prioritized and accurately measured through a systematic process including qualitative statements and quantitative limits. Risk is measured at various levels, including, but not limited to, risk type, FLU and legal entity, and also on an aggregate basis. This risk measurement process helps to capture changes in our risk profile due to changes in strategic direction,\n",
      "concentrations, portfolio quality and the overall economic environment. Senior management considers how risk exposures might evolve under a variety of stress scenarios. Monitor — We monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence to risk appetite, policies and standards. We also regularly update risk assessments and review risk exposures. Through our monitoring, we know our level of risk relative to limits and can take action in a timely manner. We also know when risk limits are breached and have processes to appropriately report and escalate exceptions. This includes timely requests for approval to managers and alerts to executive management, management-level committees or the Board (directly or through an appropriate committee). Control — We establish and communicate risk limits and controls through policies, standards, procedures and processes. The limits and controls can be adjusted by senior management or the Board when conditions or risk tolerances warrant. These\n",
      "Control — We establish and communicate risk limits and controls through policies, standards, procedures and processes. The limits and controls can be adjusted by senior management or the Board when conditions or risk tolerances warrant. These limits may be absolute (e.g., loan amount, trading volume, operational loss) or relative (e.g., percentage of loan book in higher-risk categories). Our FLUs are held accountable for performing within the established limits.\n",
      "The formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our overall risk management process. We instill a strong and comprehensive culture of managing risk well through communications, training, policies, procedures and organizational roles and responsibilities. Establishing a culture reflective of our purpose to help make our customers’ financial lives better and delivering on Responsible Growth is also critical to effective risk management. We are committed to the highest principles of ethical and professional conduct. Conduct risk is the risk of improper actions, behaviors or practices by the Corporation, its employees or representatives that are illegal, unethical and/or contrary to our core values that could result in harm to the Corporation, our shareholders or our customers, damage the integrity of the financial markets, or negatively impact our reputation. We have established protocols and structures so that conduct risk is governed and reported across the Corporation appropriately. All employees are held accountable for adhering to the Code of Conduct, operating within our risk appetite and managing risk in their daily business activities. In addition, our performance management and compensation practices encourage responsible risk-taking that is consistent with our Risk Framework and risk appetite.\n",
      "Corporation-wide Stress Testing Integral to our Capital Planning, Financial Planning and Strategic Planning processes, we conduct capital scenario management and stress forecasting on a periodic basis to better understand balance sheet, earnings and capital sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios, including economic and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These stress forecasts provide an understanding of the potential impacts from our risk profile on the balance sheet, earnings and capital, and serve as a key component of our capital and risk management practices. The intent of stress testing is to develop a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts of on- and off-balance sheet risks at the Corporation and certain subsidiaries and how they impact financial resiliency, which provides confidence to management, regulators and our investors.\n",
      "Contingency Planning We have developed and maintain contingency plans that are designed to prepare us in advance to respond in the event of\n",
      "potential adverse economic, financial or market stress. These contingency plans include our Capital Contingency Plan and Financial Contingency and Recovery Plan, which provide monitoring, escalation, actions and routines designed to enable us to increase capital, access funding sources and reduce risk through consideration of potential options that include asset sales, business sales, capital or debt issuances, and other de- risking strategies. We also maintain a Resolution Plan to limit adverse systemic impacts that could be associated with a potential resolution of Bank of America.\n",
      "Strategic Risk Management Strategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. This risk results from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments in the geographic locations in which we operate, such as competitor actions, changing customer preferences, product obsolescence and technology developments.\n",
      "An aspect of strategic risk is the risk that the Corporation’s capital levels are not adequate to meet minimum regulatory requirements and support execution of business activities or absorb losses from risks during normal or adverse economic and market conditions. As such, capital risk is managed in parallel to strategic risk.\n",
      "We manage strategic risk through the Strategic Risk Enterprise Policy and integration into the strategic planning process, among other activities. Our strategic plan is consistent with our risk appetite, capital plan and liquidity requirements, and specifically addresses strategic risks impacting each business.\n",
      "On an annual basis, the Board reviews and approves the strategic plan, capital plan, financial operating plan and Risk Appetite Statement. With oversight by the Board, senior management directs the lines of business to execute our strategic plan consistent with our core operating principles and risk appetite. The executive management team monitors business performance throughout the year and provides the Board with regular progress reports on whether strategic objectives and timelines are being met, including reports on strategic risks and if additional or alternative actions need to be considered or implemented. The regular executive reviews focus on assessing forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the current risk profile, current capital and liquidity requirements, staffing levels and changes required to support the strategic plan, stress testing results, and other qualitative factors such as market growth rates and peer analysis.\n",
      "Significant strategic actions, such as capital actions, material acquisitions or divestitures, and resolution plans are reviewed and approved by the Board. At the business level, processes are in place to discuss the strategic risk implications of new, expanded or modified businesses, products or services and other strategic initiatives, and to provide formal review and approval where required. With oversight by the Board and the ERC, executive management performs similar analyses throughout the year, and evaluates changes to the financial forecast or the risk, capital or liquidity positions as deemed appropriate to balance and optimize achieving the targeted risk appetite, shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted financial strength. Proprietary models are used to measure the capital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and strategic risks. The allocated capital assigned to each business\n",
      "is based on its unique risk profile. With oversight by the Board, executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of each business in approving strategic and financial operating plans. The businesses use allocated capital to define business strategies, and price products and transactions.\n",
      "Capital Management The Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits.\n",
      "We conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) on a periodic basis. The ICAAP is a forward- looking assessment of our projected capital needs and resources, incorporating earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts under baseline and adverse economic and market conditions. We utilize periodic stress tests to assess the potential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, regulatory capital and liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. We perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not fully captured in our forecasts or stress tests. We assess the potential capital impacts of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. Management assesses ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our capital guidelines and capital position to the Board or its committees.\n",
      "We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. For more information, see Business Segment Operations on page 84.\n",
      "CCAR and Capital Planning The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan. Based on the results of our 2022 CCAR stress test, our stress capital buffer (SCB) increased to 3.4 percent from 2.5 percent, effective October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023.\n",
      "In October 2021, the Board authorized the Corporation’s $25 billion common stock repurchase program. Additionally, the Board authorized common stock repurchases to offset shares awarded under the Corporation’s equity-based compensation plans.

The Standardized approach relies primarily on supervisory risk weights based on exposure type, and the Advanced approaches determine risk weights based on internal models.\n",
      "The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and RWA under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The lower of the capital ratios under Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements are used to assess capital adequacy, including under the PCA framework. As of December 31, 2022, the common equity tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios under the Standardized approach were the binding ratios.\n",
      "Minimum Capital Requirements In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk- based capital ratio requirements that include a_ capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced approaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach only), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. For the period from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022, the Corporation's minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement was 9.5 percent under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. Based on the results of our 2022 CCAR stress test, the Corporation’s SCB increased to 3.4 percent, resulting in a minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement of 10.4 percent under the Standardized approach for the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. Our minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement under the Advanced approaches\n",
      "remains unchanged at 9.5 percent.\n",
      "The Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent with the approach prescribed by the Basel Committee’s assessment methodology and is calculated using specified indicators of systemic importance. Method 2 modifies the Method 1 approach by, among other factors, including a measure of the Corporation’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. The Corporation’s G-SIB surcharge, which is higher under Method 2, is expected to increase to 3.0 percent from 2.5 percent on January 1, 2024, which will increase our minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement. At December 31, 2022, the Corporation’s CET1 capital ratio of 11.2 percent under the Standardized approach exceeded its current CET1 capital ratio requirement as well as the minimum requirement expected to be in place as of January 1, 2024 due to an anticipated increase in our G-SIB surcharge.\n",
      "The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The denominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted deductions, and applicable temporary exclusions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter.\n",

We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses.\n",
      "Net Stable Funding Ratio The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The requirement is intended to support\n",
      "the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. At December 31, 2022, the Corporation and its insured depository institutions were in compliance with this requirement.\n",
      "Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups.\n",
      "The primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make Parent funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.\n",
      "We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.93 trillion and $2.1 trillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Deposits are primarily generated by our Consumer Banking, GWIM and Global Banking segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with government-sponsored enterprises (GSE), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans.\n",
      "Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost- efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. For more information on secured financing agreements, see Note 10 - Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "Total long-term debt decreased $4.1 billion to $276.0 billion during 2022 primarily due to debt maturities, redemptions and valuation adjustments, partially offset by debt issuances.

Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors.\n",

During 2021, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $46.4 billion consisting of $24.4 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $10.4 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $11.6 billion of other debt.\n",
      "At December 31, 2022, Bank of America Corporation's senior notes of $205.9 billion included $179.1 billion o outstanding notes that are both TLAC eligible and callable at least one year before their stated maturities. Of these senior notes, $16.6 billion will be callable and become TLAC ineligible during 2023, and $21.4 billion, $21.3 billion, $16.0 billion and $24.4 billion will do so during each of 2024 through 2027, respectively, and $79.4 billion thereafter.\n",
      "We issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve costefficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability o1 unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by genera market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter. We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC- eligible debt. During 2022, we issued $12.5 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date.\n",
      "Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price.

In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.

In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of downgrades of our or our rated subsidiaries’ credit ratings, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to sustain losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity.

Credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications including loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held- for-sale and unfunded lending commitments, which include loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees. Derivative positions are recorded at fair value, and assets held- for-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or\n",
      "fair value. Certain loans and unfunded commitments are accounted for under the fair value option. Credit risk for categories of assets carried at fair value is not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair value adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative positions, our credit risk is measured as the net cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the current fair value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures. For more information on derivatives and credit extension commitments, see Note 3 - Derivatives and Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",

      "We refine our underwriting and credit risk management practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing economic environment. To mitigate losses and enhance customer support in our consumer businesses, we have in place collection programs and loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures. We utilize a number of actions to mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories.\n",
      "During 2022, asset quality generally improved compared to 2021. Our 2022 net charge-off ratio remained near historic lows, and nonperforming loans and commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased compared to 2021, which was partially offset by an increase in reservable criticized exposure associated with our direct exposure to Russia as a result of the Russia/Ukraine conflict. While uncertainty around the pandemic has diminished, uncertainty remains regarding broader economic impacts as a result of inflationary pressures, rising rates and the current geopolitical situation and could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods.\n",

Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition, cash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single-name concentration limits while also balancing these considerations with the total borrower or counterparty relationship. We use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations\n",

Tables 33, 36 and 39 summarize our concentrations.

Lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with our credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. In addition, we purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit exposures. To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.

Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In order to properly reflect counterparty credit risk, we record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative assets, including our purchased credit default protection. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all\n",

This exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading Risk Management.\n",
      "Trading Risk Management To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the Corporation. These measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves, such as VaR and _ stress testing. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. Qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations. Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments.\n",
      "VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data. We use one VaR model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days.\n",
      "Within any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. The accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available. For positions with insufficient historical data for the VaR calculation, the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and\n",
      "statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position. This analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience.\n",
      "VaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular, the historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. A minor portion of risks related to our trading positions is not included in VaR. These risks are reviewed as part of our ICAAP. For more information regarding ICAAP, see Capital Management on page 96.\n",
      "GRM continually reviews, evaluates and enhances our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees.\n",
      "Trading limits on quantitative risk measures, including VaR, are independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and reviewed on a regular basis so that trading limits remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks. Trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity, volatility and strategic business priorities. Trading limits are set at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors. All trading limits are approved at least annually. Approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system.

Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a defined set of specifications. These specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk elements in a two-way market. Positions in less liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions.

      "Backtesting The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to help confirm that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. We expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. For example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\n",
      "Trading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading- related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever- changing market environment. Significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed.\n",
      "The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2022 and 2021. During 2022, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 99 percent of the trading days, of which 90 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $9 million. This compares to 2021 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 97 percent of the trading days, of which 80 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $45 million.\n",
      "The trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intra-day trading revenues.\n",
      "We conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors.

This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements.\n",
      "A set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. These scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR.\n",
      "Historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress. Generally, a multi-week period representing the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide estimated portfolio impacts from potential future market stress events. Scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information. In addition, new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio. The stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management.\n",

      "Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities.\n",
      "Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.\n",
      "We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the future direction of interest rate movements as implied by market-based forward curves.\n",
      "We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our banking book balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes.\n",
      "The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital.\n",

Periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at zero. Depending on the level of interest rates, Down-rate scenarios may not receive the full impact of the rate shock, particularly in low rate environments.\n",
      "The overall decrease in asset sensitivity, as shown in the following table, to Up-rate scenarios was primarily due to an increase in long-end and short-end rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from the banking book activities.

      "The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 46 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios.\n",
      "Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts We use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options.\n",
      "The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 46. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is not significant.\n",
      "Risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency- denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the Corporation’s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are not a_ significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is not significant. For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 - Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others.

An increase in mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these instruments. Conversely, when there is an increase in interest rates, the value of the MSRs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities.\n",

      "Climate Risk Management Climate-related risks are divided into two major categories: (1) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, driven by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods, as well as chronic longer-term shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels, and (2) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes. These changes and events may have broad impacts on operations, supply chains, distribution networks, customers and markets and are otherwise referred to, respectively, as physical risk and transition risk. These risks may impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types. Physical risk may lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers’ repayment capacity or impacting the value of collateral. Physical risk may also increase operational risk by impacting the Corporation’s facilities, employees, customers or vendors. Transition risks may amplify credit risk through the financial impacts of changes in policy, technology or the market on the Corporation or its counterparties. Unanticipated market changes can lead to sudden price adjustments and give rise to heightened market risk.

      "Complex Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.\n",
      "The more judgmental estimates are summarized in the ollowing discussion. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could materially impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 - Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "The determination of the allowance for credit losses is based on numerous estimates and assumptions, which require\n",
      "a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated. A critical judgment in the process is the weighting of our forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios that are incorporated into our quantitative models. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation uses multiple macroeconomic scenarios in its ECL calculation, which have included a baseline scenario derived from consensus estimates, an adverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a downside scenario reflecting persistent inflation and interest rates above the baseline scenario, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario that considers the potential for improvement above the baseline scenario. The overall economic outlook is weighted 95 percent towards a recessionary environment in 2023, with continued inflationary pressures leading to lower gross domestic product (GDP) and higher unemployment rate expectations as compared to the prior year. Generally, as the consensus estimates improve or deteriorate, the allowance for credit losses will change in a similar direction. There are multiple variables that drive the macroeconomic scenarios with the key variables including, but not limited to, U.S. GDP and unemployment rates. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted at 5.2 percent, 4.7 percent and 4.3 percent in the fourth quarters of 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for U.S. GDP was forecasted to grow at 2.1 percent, 1.9 percent and 1.9 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the latest consensus estimates for the U.S. average unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 3.7 percent and U.S. GDP was forecasted to grow 0.4 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting a tighter labor market and depressed growth expectations compared to our macroeconomic outlook as of December 31, 2021, and were factored into our allowance for credit losses estimate as of December 31, 2022. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, the weighted macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted at 5.6 percent and 5.0 percent in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2024, and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for U.S. GDP was forecasted to contract 0.4 percent and grow 1.2 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2024. In addition to the above judgments and estimates, the allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as increases or decreases in credit and/or internal risk ratings in our commercial portfolio, improvement or deterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio and increases or decreases in home prices, which is a primary driver of LTVs, in our consumer real estate portfolio, all of which have some degree of uncertainty. The allowance for credit losses increased to $14.2 billion from $13.8 billion at December 31, 2021, primarily due to loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook in 2022.\n",
      "To provide an_ illustration of the sensitivity of the macroeconomic scenarios and other assumptions on the estimate of our allowance for credit losses, the Corporation compared the December 31, 2022 modeled ECL from the baseline scenario and our adverse scenario. Relative to the baseline scenario, the adverse scenario assumed a peak U.S. unemployment rate of nearly three percentage points higher than the baseline scenario, a decline in U.S. GDP followed by a prolonged recovery and a lower home price outlook with a difference of approximately eight percent at the trough. This\n",
      "sensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the allowance for credit losses of approximately $4 billion.\n",
      "While the sensitivity analysis may be useful to understand how changes in macroeconomic assumptions could impact our modeled ECLs, it is not meant to forecast how our allowance for credit losses is expected to change in a_ different macroeconomic outlook. Importantly, the analysis does not incorporate a variety of factors, including qualitative reserves and the weighting of alternate scenarios, which could have offsetting effects on the estimate. Considering the variety of factors contemplated when developing and_ weighting macroeconomic outlooks such as recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and industry trends, in addition to other qualitative factors, the Corporation believes the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022 is appropriate.\n",
      "Fair Value of Financial Instruments Under applicable accounting standards, we are required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. We classify fair value measurements of financial instruments and MSRs based on the three-level fair value hierarchy in the accounting standards.\n",
      "The fair values of assets and liabilities may include adjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where appropriate. Valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and _internally- modeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling. For example, broker quotes in less active markets may only be indicative and therefore less reliable. These processes and controls are performed independently of the business. For more information, see Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements and Note 21 - Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Financial assets and liabilities, and MSRs, where values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting standards. The fair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities and\n",
      "MSRs is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\n",
      "Level 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital. We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. For more information on transfers into and out of Level 3 during 2022, 2021 and 2020, see Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "Accrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets Accrued income taxes, reported as a component of either other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. We currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors, including statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance, in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction.\n",

NOL and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities, and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain periods. We consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts that we estimate are more likely than not to be realized.\n",
      "Consistent with the applicable accounting guidance, we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimates of accrued income taxes and/or net deferred tax assets due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. These revisions of our estimates, which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax audit matters, may be material to our operating results for any given period.\n",

      "Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses - Commercial and Consumer Card Loans As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management’s estimate of the expected credit losses in the\n",
      "Corporation’s loan and lease portfolio, excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value option. As of December 31, 2022, the allowance for loan and lease losses was $12.7 billion on total loans and leases of $1,040.0 billion, which excludes loans accounted for under the fair value option. For commercial and consumer card loans, the expected credit loss is typically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. In its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal as well as _ third-party economists and industry trends. Also included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. Factors that the Corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historica data.\n",
      "The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial and consumer card portfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in developing lifetime economic forecast scenarios, related weightings to each scenario and certain qualitative reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained, and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n",
      "Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overal opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses, including controls over the evaluation and approval of models, forecast scenarios and related weightings, and qualitative reserves. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the loss forecast models and methodology, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain macroeconomic variables, (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management's development, selection and weighting of lifetime economic forecast scenarios used in the loss forecast models, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate, and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves made to the\n",

      "Valuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments As described in Notes 1 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation carries certain _ financial instruments at fair value, which includes $10.7 billion of assets and $7.1 billion of liabilities classified as Level 3 fair value measurements that are valued on a recurring basis and $3.4 billion of assets classified as Level 3 fair value measurements that are valued on a nonrecurring basis, for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. The Corporation determines the fair value of Level 3 financial instruments using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs, such as volatility or implied yield, may be determined using quantitative-based extrapolations, pricing models or other internal methodologies which incorporate management estimates and available market information.\n",

      "NOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles Bank of America Corporation, a bank holding company and a financial holding company, provides a diverse range of financia services and products throughout the U.S. and in certain international markets. The term “the Corporation” as used herein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain o' Bank of America Corporation’s subsidiaries or affiliates.\n",
      "Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts o1 the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting. These investments, which include the Corporation’s interests in affordable housing and renewable energy partnerships, are recorded in other assets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment testing, and the Corporation’s proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income.\n",
      "The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\n",
      "New Accounting Standards\n",
      "Hedge Accounting The FASB issued a new accounting standard that makes targeted improvements to the application of the fair value hedge accounting guidance for closed portfolios of financial assets. The targeted improvements were effective January 1, 2023 ona prospective basis.\n",
      "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses The FASB amended the accounting and disclosure requirements for expected credit losses (ECL) by removing the recognition and measurement guidance on troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and adding disclosures on the financial effect and subsequent performance of certain types of modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. The effects of these changes on the Corporation’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are not significant. The amendments were effective on January 1, 2023, which the Corporation adopted using a modified retrospective approach.\n",
      "Significant Accounting Principles\n",
      "Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, cash segregated under federal and other brokerage regulations, and amounts due from correspondent banks, the Federal Reserve Bank and certain non-U.S. central banks. Certain cash balances are restricted as to withdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements.\n",
      "Securities Financing Agreements Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase (securities financing agreements) are treated as collateralized financing transactions except in instances where the transaction is required to be accounted for as individual sale and purchase transactions. Generally, these agreements are recorded at acquisition or sale price plus accrued interest. In instances where the interest is negative, the Corporation’s policy is to present negative interest on financial assets as interest income and negative interest on financial liabilities as interest expense. For securities financing agreements that are accounted for under the fair value option, the changes in the fair value of these securities financing agreements are recorded in market making and similar activities in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n",
      "The Corporation’s policy is to monitor the market value of the principal amount loaned under resale agreements and obtain collateral from or return collateral pledged to counterparties when appropriate. Securities financing agreements do not create material credit risk due to these collateral provisions; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not necessary.\n",
      "In transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, representing the securities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to return those securities.\n",
      "Trading Instruments Financial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at fair value. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices for the same or similar assets and liabilities. If these market prices are not available, fair values are estimated based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash _ flow methodologies, or similar techniques where the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. Realized gains and losses are recorded on a trade- date basis. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in market making and similar activities.\n",
      "Derivatives and Hedging Activities Derivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading or to support risk management activities. Derivatives used in risk management activities include derivatives that are both designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships and derivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships that are not designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships (referred to as other risk management activities). The Corporation manages interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use of derivatives. Derivatives utilized by the Corporation include swaps, futures and forward settlement contracts, and option contracts.\n",
      "All derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Corporation to settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. For exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets or is derived from observable market-based pricing parameters, similar to those applied to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation.\n",
      "Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the value of the instrument including counterparty credit risk. These values also take into account the Corporation’s own credit standing.\n",
      "Trading Derivatives and Other Risk Management Activities Derivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with changes in fair value included in market making and similar activities.\n",
      "Derivatives used for other risk management activities are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivatives used in other risk management activities have not been designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships because they did not qualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to an item that is reported at fair value through earnings so that the effect of measuring the derivative instrument and the asset or liability to which the risk exposure pertains will offset in the Consolidated Statement of Income to the extent effective. The changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate certain risks associated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and first-lien mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation are recorded in other income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are included in market making and_ similar activities. Credit derivatives are also used by the Corporation to mitigate the risk associated with various credit exposures. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in market making and similar activities and other income.\n",
      "Derivatives Used For Hedge Accounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges) For accounting hedges, the Corporation formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. Additionally, the Corporation primarily uses regression analysis at the inception of a hedge and for each reporting period thereafter to assess whether the derivative used in an accounting hedge transaction is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item or forecasted transaction. The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, and then reflects changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings after termination of the hedge relationship.\n",
      "Fair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the fair value of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities that are attributable to interest rate or foreign exchange volatility. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value\n",
      "hedges are recorded in earnings, together and in the same income statement line item with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item. If a derivative instrument in a fair value hedge is terminated or the hedge designation removed, the previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other components of the carrying value of that asset or liability. For interestearning assets and _ interest-bearing liabilities, such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the respective asset or liability.\n",
      "Cash flow hedges are used primarily to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets and liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by interest rate or foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The Corporation also uses cash flow hedges to hedge the price risk associated with deferred compensation. Changes in the fair value of derivatives used in cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) and are reclassified into the line item in the income statement in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item affects earnings. Components of a derivative that are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness are recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged item.\n",
      "Net investment hedges are used to manage the foreign exchange rate sensitivity arising from a net investment in a foreign operation. Changes in the spot prices of derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI. The remaining components of these derivatives are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness and are recorded in market making and similar activities.\n",
      "Securities Debt securities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their trade date. Their classification is dependent on the purpose for which the securities were acquired. Debt securities purchased for use in the Corporation’s trading activities are reported in trading account assets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in market making and_ similar activities. Substantially all other debt securities purchased are used in the Corporation’s asset and liability management (ALM) activities and are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either debt securities carried at fair value or as held-to- maturity (HTM) debt securities. Debt securities carried at fair value are either available-forssale (AFS) securities with unrealized gains and losses net-of-tax included in accumulated OCI or carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in market making and similar activities. HTM debt securities are debt securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost.\n",
      "The Corporation evaluates each AFS security where the value has declined below amortized cost. If the Corporation intends to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security, it is written down to fair value through earnings. For AFS debt securities the Corporation intends to hold, the Corporation evaluates the debt securities for ECL, except for debt securities that are guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies or sovereign entities of high credit quality where the Corporation applies a zero credit loss assumption. For the remaining AFS debt securities, the Corporation considers qualitative parameters such as internal and external credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral. If an AFS debt security fails any of the qualitative parameters, a discounted cash flow analysis is used by the Corporation to\n",
      "determine if a portion of the unrealized loss is a result of an ECL. The Corporation will then recognize either credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense in other income for the amount necessary to adjust the debt securities valuation allowance to its current estimate of expected credit losses. Cash flows expected to be collected are estimated using all relevant information available such as remaining payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of the underlying collateral. If any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that amount is recognized in accumulated OCI. In certain instances, the credit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in which case, the allowance recorded is limited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the asset.\n",
      "The Corporation separately evaluates its HTM debt securities for any credit losses, of which substantially all qualify for the zero loss assumption. For the remaining securities, the Corporation performs a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate any credit losses which are then recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses.\n",
      "Interest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in interest income. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted to interest income at a constant effective yield over the contractual lives of the securities. Realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities are determined using the specific identification method.\n",
      "Equity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not held for trading purposes are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in other income. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus qualifying observable price changes. These securities are reported in other assets.\n",
      "Loans and Leases Loans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair value option, are measured at historical cost and reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, and for purchased loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the related loans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income using a level yield methodology. The Corporation elects to account for certain consumer and commercial loans under the fair value option with interest reported in interest income and changes in fair value reported in market making and similar activities or other income. Under applicable accounting guidance, for reporting\n",
      "Under applicable accounting guidance, for reporting purposes, the loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio segment and, within each portfolio segment, by class of financing receivable. A portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a_ systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class of financing receivable is defined as the level of disaggregation of portfolio segments based on the initial measurement attribute, risk characteristics and methods for assessing risk. The Corporation’s three portfolio segments are Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial. The classes within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment are residential mortgage and home equity. The classes within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment are credit card, direct/indirect consumer and other\n",
      "consumer. The classes within the Commercial portfolio segment are U.S. commercial, non-U.S. commercial, commercial real estate, commercial lease financing and U.S. small business commercial.\n",
      "Leases The Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers through a variety of lessor arrangements. Direct financing leases and sales-type leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income, which is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that approximate the interest method. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Corporation's lease arrangements generally do not contain non-lease components.\n",
      "Allowance for Credit Losses On January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, which includes both the allowance or loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, to be based on management’s best estimate of the ECL in the Corporation’s loan and lease portfolio, excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Upon adoption, a $3.3 billion, or 32 percent, increase in the allowance for credit losses was recorded on January 1, 2020, which was comprised of a net increase of $2.9 billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a $310 million increase in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The ECL on funded consumer and commercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance for loan and lease losses and is reported separately as a contra- asset to loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. he ECL for unfunded lending commitments, including home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan commitments is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other iabilities. The provision for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income at the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the current estimate of ECL.\n",
      "For loans and leases, the ECL is typically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. The life of the loan for closed-ended products is based on the contractual maturity of the loan adjusted for any expected prepayments. The contractual maturity includes any extension options that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For open- ended products (e.g., lines of credit), the ECL is determined based on the maximum repayment term associated with future draws from credit lines unless those lines of credit are unconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which case the Corporation does not record any allowance.\n",
      "In its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels and corporate bond spreads. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter\n",
      "and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and industry trends.\n",
      "The estimate of credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off (i.e., negative allowance). If a loan has been charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan are not limited by the current amortized cost balance. Instead, expected cash flows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal balance immediately prior to the charge-off.\n",
      "The allowance for loan and lease losses for TDRs is measured based on the present value of projected future lifetime principal and interest cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate, or in cases where foreclosure is probable or the loan is collateral dependent, at the loan’s collateral value or its observable market price, if available. The measurement of ECL for the renegotiated consumer credit card TDR portfolio is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average TDR portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. Projected cash flows for TDRs use the same economic outlook as discussed above. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool.\n",
      "Also included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions described above. For example, factors that the Corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data.\n",
      "With the exception of the Corporation's credit card portfolio, the Corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable in the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the Corporation generally classifies consumer loans as nonperforming at 90 days past due and reverses interest income for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the Corporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and fee income against the income statement line item where it was originally recorded.\n",
      "The Corporation has identified the following three portfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods.\n",
      "Consumer Real Estate To estimate ECL for consumer loans secured by residential real estate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default over the life of the existing portfolio, after factoring in estimated prepayments, using quantitative modeling methodologies. The attributes that are most significant in estimating the Corporation’s ECL include refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination and geography, all of which are further broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default, or in bankruptcy). The estimates are based on the\n",
      "Corporation’s historical experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect the economic outlook. The outlook on the unemployment rate and consumer real estate prices are key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates. The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses on the unpaid principal balance of loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and long-term standby loans, as these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records a reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the undrawn portion of the Corporation’s HELOCs, which can only be canceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met. The ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies noted above and incorporate utilization assumptions at time o default.\n",
      "For loans that are more than 180 days past due and collateral-dependent TDRs, the Corporation bases the allowance on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the reporting date less costs to sell. The fair value of the collatera securing these loans is generally determined using an automated valuation model (AVM) that estimates the value of a property by reference to market data including sales o comparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the Corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral. While there is inherent imprecision in these valuations, the Corporation believes that they are representative of this portfolio in the aggregate.\n",
      "For loans that are more than 180 days past due and collateral-dependent TDRs, with the exception of the Corporation’s fully insured portfolio, the outstanding balance of loans that is in excess of the estimated property value after adjusting for costs to sell is charged off. If the estimated property value decreases in periods subsequent to the initial charge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off; however, if the value increases in periods subsequent to the charge-off, the Corporation will adjust the allowance to account for the increase but not to a level above the cumulative charge- off amount.\n",
      "Credit Cards and Other Consumer Credit cards are revolving lines of credit without a defined maturity date. The estimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by estimating the amount and timing of expected future payments (e.g., borrowers making full payments, minimum payments or somewhere in between) that it will take for a receivable balance to pay off. The ECL on the future payments incorporates the spending behavior of a borrower through time using key borrower-specific factors and the economic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all expected payments in accordance with the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (i.e., paying down the highest interest rate bucket first). Then forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance until it is brought to zero or an expected charge-off amount. Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all key inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model. Future draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally cancellable.\n",
      "The ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is also determined using quantitative methods supplemented with\n",
      "qualitative analysis. The quantitative model estimates ECL giving consideration to key borrower and loan characteristics such as delinquency status, borrower credit score, LTV ratio, underlying collateral type and collateral value.\n",
      "Commercial The ECL on commercial loans is forecasted using models that estimate credit losses over the loan’s contractual life at an individual loan level. The models use the contractual terms to forecast future principal cash flows while also considering expected prepayments. For open-ended commitments such as revolving lines of credit, changes in funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower’s draw and payment behavior over the remaining life of the commitment. For loans collateralized with commercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source of repayment, the loss forecasting models consider key loan and customer attributes such as LTV ratio, net operating income and debt service coverage, and captures variations in behavior according to property type and region. The outlook on the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and forecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators such as rent levels and vacancy rates, which impact the ECL estimate. For all other commercial loans and leases, the loss forecasting model determines the probabilities of transition to different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the borrower’s current credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market. The severity of loss is determined based on the type of collateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower's industry sector, any guarantors and the geographic market. Assumptions of expected loss are conditioned to the economic outlook, and the model considers key economic variables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, corporate bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices and equity market returns.\n",
      "In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation also estimates ECL related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Reserves are estimated for the unfunded exposure using the same models and methodologies as the funded exposure and are reported as_ reserves for unfunded lending commitments.\n",
      "Nonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies Nonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Loans accounted for under the fair value option and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming. When a nonaccrual loan is deemed uncollectible, it is charged off against the allowance for credit losses. If the charged-off amount is later recovered, the amount is reversed through the allowance for credit losses at the recovery date. Charge-offs are reported net of recoveries (net charge-offs). If recoveries for the period are greater than charge- offs, net charge-offs are reported as a negative amount.\n",
      "In accordance with the Corporation’s policies, consumer real estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home equity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming at 90 days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the FHA or through individually insured long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae (FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). Residential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not\n",
      "placed on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the underlying first-lien mortgage loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of real estate-secured loans that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless the loan is fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy, within 60 days of receipt of notification of filing, with the remaining balance classified as nonperforming.\n",
      "Credit card and other unsecured consumer loans are charged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy or upon confirmation of fraud. These loans continue to accrue interest until they are charged off and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming loans. Consumer vehicle loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due, within 6O days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or death or upon confirmation of fraud. These loans are charged off to their collateral values when the loans become 120 days past due, upon repossession of the collateral, within 60 days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or death or upon confirmation of fraud. If repossession of the collateral is not expected, the loans are fully charged off.\n",
      "Commercial loans and leases, excluding business card loans, that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, including loans that are individually identified as being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the process of collection.\n",
      "Business card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer credit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible.\n",
      "The entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or lease is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date on the customer's billing statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. Accrued interest receivable is reversed when loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status. Interest collections on nonaccruing loans and leases for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income when received. Loans and leases may be restored to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected.\n",
      "Troubled Debt Restructurings Consumer and commercial loans and leases whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties are classified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions designed to maximize collections. Loans that are carried at fair value and LHFS are not classified as TDRs.\n",
      "Loans and leases whose contractual terms have been modified in a TDR and are current at the time of restructuring may remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under the restructured terms is expected. Otherwise, the loans are\n",
      "placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming, except for fully-insured consumer real estate loans, until there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. If accruing TDRs cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, they are placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs.\n",
      "Secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge. Such loans are placed on nonaccrual status and written down to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell no later than at the time of discharge. If these loans are contractually current, interest collections are generally recorded in interest income on a cash basis. Consumer real estate-secured loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs. Credit card and other unsecured consumer loans that have been renegotiated in a TDR generally remain on accrual status until the loan is either paid in full or charged off, which occurs no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due or, for loans that have been placed on a fixed payment plan, 120 days past due.\n",
      "A loan that had previously been modified in a TDR and is subsequently refinanced under current underwriting standards at a market rate with no concessionary terms is accounted for as a new loan and is no longer reported as a TDR.\n",
      "Loans Held-for-sale Loans that the Corporation intends to sell in the foreseeable future, including residential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan, are recognized as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that are on nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy herein, are reported separately from nonperforming loans and leases.\n",
      "Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to 40 years for buildings, up to 12 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements.\n",
      "Other Assets For the Corporation’s financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates these assets for ECL using various techniques. For assets that are subject to collateral maintenance provisions, including federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, where the collateral consists of daily margining of liquid and marketable assets where the margining is expected to be maintained into the foreseeable future, the expected losses are assumed to be zero. For all other assets, the Corporation performs qualitative analyses, including consideration of historical losses and current economic conditions, to estimate any ECL which are\n",
      "then included in a valuation account that is recorded as a contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of the financial asset.\n",
      "Lessee Arrangements Substantially all of the Corporation’s lessee arrangements are operating leases. Under these arrangements, the Corporation records rightof-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement. Right-of-use assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related lease liabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities. All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for which the Corporation made the short-term lease election. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in occupancy and equipment expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n",
      "The Corporation made an accounting policy election not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract that is or contains a lease for its real estate and equipment leases. As such, lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. At lease commencement, lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments and discounted using the Corporation’s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets initially equal the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and for any lease incentives.\n",
      "Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is a business segment or one level below a business segment.\n",
      "The Corporation assesses the fair value of each reporting unit against its carrying value, including goodwill, as measured by allocated equity. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. In performing its goodwill impairment testing, the\n",
      "In performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-unit specific considerations.\n",
      "If the Corporation concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed. The Corporation has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Corporation may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.\n",
      "When performing the quantitative assessment, if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit would not be considered impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by\n",
      "which the reporting unit’s allocated equity exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. An impairment loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill, and subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted under applicable accounting guidance.\n",
      "For intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying value of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value.\n",
      "Variable Interest Entities A VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity through their equity investments. The Corporation consolidates a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the Corporation reassesses its involvement with the VIE and evaluates the impact of changes in governing documents and its financial interests in the VIE. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which the Corporation is involved may change as a result of such reassessments.\n",
      "The Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitization activities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt securities into a trust or other vehicle. When the Corporation is the servicer of whole loans held in a securitization trust, including non-agency residential mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, and other loans, the Corporation has the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust. The Corporation generally does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of a residential mortgage agency trust except in certain circumstances in which the Corporation holds substantially all of the issued securities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the trust. The power to direct the most significant activities of a commercial mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the special servicer or by the party holding specific subordinate securities which embody certain controlling rights. The Corporation consolidates a whole-loan securitization trust if it has the power to direct the most significant activities and also holds securities issued by the trust or has other contractual arrangements, other than standard representations and warranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust.\n",
      "warranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation may also transfer trading account securities and AFS securities into municipal bond or resecuritization trusts. The Corporation consolidates a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities of the trust such as the remarketing of the trust’s liabilities or, if there are no ongoing activities, sole discretion over the design of the trust, including the identification of securities to be transferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and also retains securities or has liquidity or other commitments that could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation does not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if one or a limited number of third-party investors share responsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the significant activities of the trust through liquidation or other substantive rights.\n",
      "Other VIEs used by the Corporation include collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on behalf of customers and other investment vehicles. The Corporation does not routinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and, therefore, does not typically have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a CDO. However, following an event of default, if the Corporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued by a CDO and acquires the power to manage its assets, the Corporation consolidates the CDO.\n",
      "The Corporation consolidates a customer or _ other investment vehicle if it has control over the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs potentially significant gains or losses through an investment in the vehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements. The Corporation does not consolidate an investment vehicle if a single investor controlled the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does not have a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the vehicle.\n",
      "Retained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded at fair value. In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt securities issued by unconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of these debt securities, which are classified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities, are based primarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets. Generally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests are not available; therefore, the Corporation estimates fair values based on the present value of the associated expected future cash flows.\n",
      "Fair Value The Corporation measures the fair values of its assets and liabilities, where applicable, in accordance with accounting guidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price. Under this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. Under applicable accounting standards, fair value measurements are categorized into one o three levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its fair value measurements 01 financial instruments based on this three-level hierarchy.\n",
      "Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in OTC markets. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts where fair value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes U.S. government and Level 2\n",
      "agency mortgage-backed (MBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS), corporate debt securities, derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS. Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the overall fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. The fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models, discounted cash _ flow methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. This category generally includes retained residual interests in securitizations, consumer MSRs, certain ABS, highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS, IRLCs and certain CDOs where independent pricing information cannot be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets. Level 3\n",
      "Income Taxes There are two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management concludes are more likely than not to be realized.\n",
      "Income tax benefits are recognized and measured based upon a two-step model: first, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order to be recognized, and second, the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. The Corporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within income tax expense.\n",
      "Revenue Recognition The following summarizes the Corporation’s revenue recognition accounting policies for certain noninterest income activities.\n",
      "Card Income Card income includes annual, late and over-limit fees as well as interchange, cash advances and other miscellaneous items from credit and debit card transactions and from processing card transactions for merchants. Card income is presented net of direct costs. Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement of the credit and debit card payment transactions and are generally determined on a percentage basis for credit cards and fixed rates for debit cards based on _ the corresponding payment network’s rates. Substantially all card fees are recognized at the transaction date, except for certain time-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over 12 months. Fees charged to cardholders and merchants that are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance\n",
      "for loan and lease losses. Included in direct cost are rewards and credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to cardholders are related to points earned by the cardholder that can be redeemed for a broad range of rewards including cash, travel and gift cards. The points to be redeemed are estimated based on past redemption behavior, card product type, account transaction activity and other historical card performance. The liability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The Corporation also makes payments to credit card partners. The payments are based on revenue-sharing agreements that are generally driven by cardholder transactions and partner sales volumes. As part of the revenue-sharing agreements, the credit card partner provides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the credit card partner's members or customers on behalf of the Corporation.\n",
      "Service Charges Service charges include deposit and lending-related fees. Deposit-related fees consist of fees earned on consumer and commercial deposit activities and are generally recognized when the transactions occur or as the service is performed. Consumer fees are earned on consumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and various transaction-based services, such as ATM transactions, wire transfer activities, check and money order processing and insufficient funds/overdraft transactions. Commercial deposit-related fees are from the Corporation’s Global Transaction Services business and consist of commercial deposit and treasury management services, including account maintenance and other services, such as _ payroll, sweep account and other cash management services. Lending-related fees generally represent transactional fees earned from certain loan commitments, financial guarantees and SBLCs.\n",
      "Investment and Brokerage Services Investment and brokerage services consist of asset management and brokerage fees. Asset management fees are earned from the management of client assets under advisory agreements or the full discretion of the Corporation’s financial advisors (collectively referred to as assets under management (AUM)). Asset management fees are earned as a percentage of the client’s AUM and generally range from 50 basis points (bps) to 150 bps of the AUM. In cases where a third party is used to obtain a client’s investment allocation, the fee remitted to the third party is recorded net and is not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.\n",
      "Brokerage fees include income earned from transaction- based services that are performed as part of investment management services and are based on a fixed price per unit or as a percentage of the total transaction amount. Brokerage fees also include distribution fees and sales commissions that are primarily in the Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) segment and are earned over time. In addition, primarily in the Global Markets segment, brokerage fees are earned when the Corporation fills customer orders to buy or sell various financial products or when it acknowledges, affirms, settles and clears transactions and/or submits trade information to the appropriate clearing broker. Certain customers pay brokerage, clearing and/or exchange fees imposed by relevant regulatory bodies or exchanges in order to execute or clear trades. These fees are recorded net and are not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.\n",
      "Investment Banking Income Investment banking income includes underwriting income and financial advisory services income. Underwriting consists of fees\n",
      "earned for the placement of a customer’s debt or equity securities. The revenue is generally earned based on a percentage of the fixed number of shares or principal placed. Once the number of shares or notes is determined and the service is completed, the underwriting fees are recognized. The Corporation incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses, such as legal costs, in performing these services. These expenses are recovered through the revenue the Corporation earns from the customer and are included in operating expenses. Syndication fees represent fees earned as the agent or lead lender responsible for structuring, arranging and administering a loan syndication.\n",
      "Financial advisory services consist of fees earned for assisting clients with transactions related to mergers and acquisitions and financial restructurings. Revenue varies depending on the size of the transaction and scope of services performed and is generally contingent on successful completion of the transaction. Revenue is typically recognized once the transaction is completed and all services have been rendered. Additionally, the Corporation may earn a fixed fee in merger and acquisition transactions to provide a fairness opinion, with the fees recognized when the opinion is delivered to the client.\n",
      "Other Revenue Measurement and Recognition Policies The Corporation did not disclose the value of any open performance obligations at December 31, 2022, as its contracts with customers generally have a fixed term that is less than one year, an open term with a cancellation period that is less than one year, or provisions that allow the Corporation to recognize revenue at the amount it has the right to invoice.\n",
      "Earnings Per Common Share Earnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted- average common shares outstanding, excluding unvested\n",
      "common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Net income allocated to common shareholders is net income adjusted for preferred stock dividends including dividends declared, accretion of discounts on preferred stock including accelerated accretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that have not been declared as of period end, less income allocated to participating securities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income allocated to common shareholders plus dividends on dilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can be tendered to exercise warrants, by the weighted-average common shares outstanding plus amounts representing the dilutive effect of stock options outstanding, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), outstanding warrants and the dilution resulting from the conversion of convertible preferred stock, if applicable.\n",
      "Foreign Currency Translation Assets, liabilities and operations of foreign branches and subsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of each entity. When the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local currency, the assets, liabilities and operations are translated, for consolidation purposes, from the local currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency at period-end rates for assets and liabilities and generally at average rates for results of operations. The resulting unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated OCI, net-of-tax. When the foreign entity’s functional currency is the U.S. dollar, the resulting remeasurement gains or losses on foreign currency- denominated assets or liabilities are included in earnings.\n",

FICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower's credit history.

      "Credit card and other consumer loans are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for credit card and other consumer. Based on historical experience, the Corporation estimates that 15 percent of new credit card TDRs and 15 percent of new direct/indirect consumer TDRs may be in payment default within 12 months after modification.\n",
      "Commercial Loans Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation’s loss exposure while providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique and reflects the individual circumstances of the borrower. Modifications that result in a TDR may include extensions of maturity at a concessionary (below market) rate of interest, payment forbearances or other actions designed to benefit the borrower while mitigating the Corporation’s risk exposure.\n",
      "Reductions in interest rates are rare. Instead, the interest rates are typically increased, although the increased rate may not represent a market rate of interest. Infrequently, concessions may also include principal forgiveness in connection with foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements leading to termination or sale of the loan.\n",
      "At the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to reflect the impact, if any, on projected cash flows resulting from the modified terms. If a portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a charge-off may be recorded at the time of restructuring. Alternatively, a charge-off may have already been recorded in a previous period such that no charge-off is required at the time of modification.\n",
      "During 2022, the carrying value of the Corporation’s commercial loans that were modified as TDRs was $1.9 billion compared to $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion for 2021 and 2020. At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had commitments to lend $358 million, $283 million and $402 million to commercial borrowers whose loans were classified as TDRs.

      "the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The Corporation incorporates forward-looking information through the use of several macroeconomic scenarios in determining the weighted economic outlook over the forecasted life of the assets. These scenarios include key macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate, real estate prices and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, internal and third-party economist views, and industry trends. For more information on the Corporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.\n",
      "The December 31, 2022 estimate for allowance for credit losses was based on various economic scenarios, including a baseline scenario derived from consensus estimates, an adverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a downside scenario reflecting persistent inflation and interest rates above the baseline scenario, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario that considers the potential for improvement above the baseline scenario. The overall economic outlook is weighted 95 percent towards a recessionary environment in 2023, with continued inflationary pressures leading to lower GDP and higher unemployment rate expectations as compared to the prior year. The weighted economic outlook assumes that the U.S. average unemployment rate will be above five and a half percent by the fourth quarter of 2023 and will slowly decline to five percent by the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, in this economic outlook, U.S. gross domestic product is forecasted to contract at 0.4 percent and grow at 1.2 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2024. For comparison, as of December 31, 2021, the weighted economic outlook for the U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted to be just above five percent by the fourth quarter of 2022 and slowly decline to just under five percent by the fourth quarter of 2023 and U.S. gross domestic product was forecasted at 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2023.\n",
      "The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022 was 14.2 billion, an increase of $379 million compared to December 31, 2021. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reserve release for reduced pandemic uncertainties. The change in the allowance or credit losses was comprised of a net increase of $295 million in the allowance for loan and lease losses and an increase of $84 million in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was attributed to increases in the credit card and other consumer portfolios of $341 million, and commercial portfolio of $177 million, partially offset by a decrease in the consumer real estate portfolio of $139 million. The provision for credit losses increased $7.1 billion to an expense of $2.5 billion in 2022 compared to a benefit of $4.6 billion in 2021 and an expense of $11.3 billion in 2020. The increase in the provision for credit losses in 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by reduced pandemic uncertainties.

      "Reserve and Related Provision The reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees was $612 million and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related provision is included in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The representations and warranties reserve represents the Corporation’s best estimate\n",
      "of probable incurred losses, is based on its experience in previous negotiations, and is subject to judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known or unknown uncertainties. Future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures; however, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the Corporation's financial condition and liquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory Matters below for the Corporation's combined range of possible loss in excess of the reserve for representations and warranties and the accrued liability for litigation.\n",
      "Litigation and Regulatory Matters In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental actions and proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter.\n",
      "As a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable, and, for the matters below, whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of expense. The Corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. Excluding expenses of internal and external legal service providers, litigation and regulatory investigation-related expense of $1.2 billion and $164 million was recognized in 2022 and 2021.\n",
      "For any matter disclosed in this Note for which a loss in future periods is reasonably possible and estimable (whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability) and for representations and warranties exposures, the Corporation's estimated range of possible loss is $0 to $0.8 billion in excess of the accrued liability, if any, as of December 31, 2022.\n",
      "The accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are based upon currently available information and subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are unpredictable and may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate and accrual. The estimated range of possible loss does not represent the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure.\n",
      "Information is provided below regarding the nature of the litigation and, where specified, associated claimed damages. Based on current knowledge, and taking into account accrued liabilities, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matters described below, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in light of the significant judgment, variety of assumptions and uncertainties involved in those matters, some of which are beyond the Corporation’s control, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of those matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of those matters could be\n",

      "Deposit Insurance Assessment On January 9, 2017, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) filed suit against BANA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (“District Court”) alleging failure to pay a December 15, 2016 invoice for additional deposit insurance assessments and interest in the amount of $542 million for the quarters ending June 30, 2013 through December 31, 2014.\n",
      "On April 7, 2017, the FDIC amended its complaint to add a claim for additional deposit insurance and interest in the amount of $583 million for the quarters ending March 31, 2012 through March 31, 2013. The FDIC asserts these claims based on BANA’s alleged underreporting of counterparty exposures that resulted in underpayment of assessments for those quarters, and its Enforcement Section is also conducting a parallel investigation related to the same alleged reporting error. BANA disagrees with the FDIC’s interpretation of the regulations as they existed during the relevant time period and is defending itself against the FDIC’s claims. Pending final resolution, BANA has pledged security satisfactory to the FDIC related to the disputed additional assessment amounts. On March 27, 2018, the District Court denied BANA’s partial motion to dismiss certain of the FDIC’s claims. On January 24, 2023, the magistrate judge assigned to the matter by the District Court judge held oral argument on the parties’ motions for summary judgment and took the motions under advisement.\n",
      "LIBOR The Corporation, BANA and certain Merrill Lynch entities have been named as defendants along with most of the other LIBOR panel banks in a number of individual and putative class actions by persons alleging they sustained losses on U.S. dollar LIBOR- based financial instruments as a result of collusion or manipulation by defendants regarding the setting of U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plaintiffs assert a variety of claims, including antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO), Securities Exchange Act of 1934, common law fraud and breach of contract claims, and seek compensatory, treble and punitive damages, and _ injunctive relief. All but one of the cases naming the Corporation and its affiliates relating to U.S. dollar LIBOR are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (“District Court”). The District Court has dismissed all RICO claims, and dismissed all manipulation claims against Bank of America entities based on alleged trader conduct. The District Court has also substantially limited the scope of antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act and various other claims, including by dismissing in their entirety certain individual and putative class plaintiffs’ antitrust claims for lack of standing. On December 30, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of these antitrust claims for lack of standing. Certain individual and putative class actions remain pending against the Corporation, BANA and certain Merrill Lynch entities. On February 28, 2018, the District Court granted certification of a class of persons that purchased OTC swaps and notes that referenced U.S. dollar LIBOR from one of the U.S. dollar LIBOR panel banks, limited to claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\n",

The RSUs granted in 2022 will generally vest over four years. Of the RSUs granted in 2021, 81 million will generally vest over four years and 18 million will vest over three years. The four-year awards vest primarily in one-fourth increments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date while the three-year awards vest primarily in one-third increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that time, and will be expensed ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, for non- retirement eligible employees based on the grant-date fair value of the shares.

The majority of the Corporation’s U.K. net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of NOLS, are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years.

The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting standards that require an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its financial instruments into three levels based on the established fair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become unobservable or observable in the current marketplace. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles. The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 21 - Fair Value Option.\n",
      "Valuation Techniques The following sections outline the valuation methodologies for the Corporation’s assets and liabilities.

      "Trading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities The fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions. The fair values of debt securities are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair values of trading account assets and liabilities and debt securities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions such as positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Some of these instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow model, which estimates the fair value of the securities using internal credit risk, and interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate management’s best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment rates. Principal and interest cash flows are discounted using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value for the specific security. Other instruments are valued using a net asset value approach which considers the value of the underlying securities. Underlying assets are valued using external pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing based on the vintages and ratings. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the market's perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors,\n",
      "principally from reviewing the issuer’s financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies.\n",
      "Derivative Assets and Liabilities The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. When third-party pricing services are used, the methods and assumptions are reviewed by the Corporation. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and _ liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit quality and other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the Corporation’s own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates FVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market data.\n",
      "Loans and Loan Commitments The fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on market prices, where available, or discounted cash flow analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt instruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or comparable borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow analyses may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other market conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower.\n",
      "Mortgage Servicing Rights The fair values of MSRs are primarily determined using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach, which factors in prepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates.\n",
      "Loans Held-for-sale The fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation’s current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. The borrower-specific credit risk is embedded within the quoted market prices or is implied by considering loan performance when selecting comparables.\n",
      "Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, interest rates, indices, currencies or commodities. The fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using quantitative models for the combined derivative and debt portions of the notes. These models incorporate observable and, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs. The Corporation also considers the impact of its own credit spread in determining the discount rate used to value these liabilities. The credit spread is determined by reference to observable spreads in the secondary bond market.\n",
      "Securities Financing Agreements The fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services.\n",

Default correlation is a parameter that describes the degree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio that underlies a credit derivative instrument. The sensitivity of this input on the fair value varies depending on the level of subordination of the tranche.

These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for designation as accounting hedges and are carried at fair value. The fair value option allows the Corporation to carry these loans and loan commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with management’s view of the underlying economics and the manner in which they are managed.

      "Annual Report\n",
      "Wells Fargo & Company\n",
      "WELLS FARGO\n",
      "CEO Letter\n",
      "Dear Shareholders,\n",
      "I’m proud to report that Wells Fargo continued to make progress on our priorities in 2022. Our underlying financial performance is improving, we are moving forward on our risk, control and regulatory agenda, we are focusing on businesses where we can generate appropriate risk-adjusted returns, we continue to strengthen the leadership team, and we are executing on our strategic objectives. While we have made progress, our work is not complete and we remain focused on successful and timely execution of our multi-year journey to complete our risk and control work and to move forward with our businesses.\n",
      "Stronger financial performance\n",
      "Our financial performance benefitted as we continued to drive improved efficiency, and it was positively impacted by both rising rates and a benign credit environment.\n",
      "In 2022, Wells Fargo generated $13.2 billion in net income, or $3.17 per common share. Our results were significantly impacted by $7 billion of operating losses, primarily related to putting historical issues behind us, including litigation, regulatory matters, and customer remediations. However, our performance excluding those items was solid and demonstrates the continued progress we are making to improve returns.\n",
      "Our revenue decreased 6% from the previous year. The higher rate environment and good loan growth drove strong growth in net interest income, which was up 26% from a year ago. However, this growth was more than offset by lower net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking, and investment advisory and other asset-based fees reflecting market conditions, as well as the lost revenue related to businesses we sold in 2021.\n",
      "Expenses increased 6% from a year ago, reflecting higher operating losses primarily related to putting historical matters behind us, as noted above. Excluding operating losses, noninterest expense declined from a year ago, reflecting continued progress on our efficiency initiatives and the impact from business sales. We achieved these efficiency gains while we made continued investments in our risk and control infrastructure and in strategic initiatives across our businesses, and in the face of continued inflationary pressures.\n",
      "Credit quality remained strong, but, as expected, losses started to slowly increase in the second half of the year off their\n",
      "historical lows. Our net charge-off rate declined from 18 basis points in 2021 to 17 basis points in 2022, and our allowance for credit losses declined by $75 million in 2022, as our reserve release in the first quarter was slightly larger than the reserve builds we had in the last three quarters of the year.\n",
      "Loans outstanding increased by 7% from one year ago, with growth in both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Consumer Banking and Lending grew 4%, driven by growth in residential mortgage and credit card, which offset a decline in auto loans. Both Commercial Banking and Corporate and Investment Banking had strong loan growth, with commercial loans up 9% from a year ago, driven by growth across all asset classes. Average deposits in 2022 decreased 1% to $1.42 trillion, as higher market rates spurred customers to look for higher yielding alternatives, and consumers continued to spend savings that built up during the pandemic.\n",
      "Our capital levels remained well above our required regulatory minimums plus buffers. We increased our quarterly common stock dividend in the first quarter of 2022 from $0.20 per share to $0.25 per share and then to $0.30 in the third quarter of 2022. While we did not repurchase any common stock in the last three quarters of 2022, we have repurchased shares in the first quarter of 2023.\n",
      "Our return on equity was 7.5% and our return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) was 9.0%1. Both of these ratios were impacted by the operating losses I highlighted earlier.\n",
      "In my shareholder letter over the past two years, I have discussed our path to higher returns. Since 2020, we have executed on a number of important items to improve our returns, including returning $16 billion to shareholders through net common stock repurchases, increasing our common stock dividend from $0.10 per share to $0.30 per share, and delivering approximately $7.5 billion of gross expense saves. Based on these actions and others that are in flight, we believe we have a clear line of sight to a sustainable ROTCE of approximately 15% in the medium term. In order to achieve that, we need to continue to optimize our capital, including returning capital to shareholders and redeploying capital to higher returning businesses; execute on efficiency initiatives; and benefit from the investments we are making in our businesses.\n",
      "1 Return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the “Financial Review – Capital Management – Tangible Common Equity” section in this Report.\n",
      "2022 Annual Report\n",
      "We are actively watching the economy\n",
      "Consumers\n",
      "After a period of strong economic growth and low unemployment, the Federal Reserve has been increasing interest rates aggressively with a goal of combatting high inflation. Increasing interest rates and a slowing economy have caused headwinds for some of our customers, but our customers have largely remained resilient over the past year, with deposit balances, consumer spending and credit quality still stronger than pre-pandemic levels.\n",
      "Consumer credit card spend continued to be strong in 2022, with spending up 25% compared with 2021, which reflects the benefit of new Wells Fargo product launches. Almost all spending categories had double-digit spend growth year over year. Consumer debit card spend slowed to 3% growth in 2022 compared to 2021. Growth was driven by ticket size since transaction volume was flat year-over-year, and discretionary spend outpaced non-discretionary spend.\n",
      "At the same time, we are carefully watching the impact of higher rates and we expect to see deposit balances continue to decrease and credit quality to continue to weaken. For certain cohorts of customers, average deposit balances are below pre-pandemic levels, and we are closely monitoring activity for signs of potential stress. For our borrowers, we are working to limit the risk – both to them and to us – of overextension. We have taken selective actions across our consumer lending businesses to mitigate risks associated with inflation and increased debt leverage. In our auto business, we have adjusted policies to address risk associated with collateral value declines and inflationary pressures on consumers’ ability to pay. In home lending, we have tightened loan-to-value policies nationally and even more so in local markets that have elevated home value risk. Additionally, in our card business, we have tightened our lending policy to focus on applicants who may be exhibiting debt-seeking behavior.\n",
      "Businesses\n",
      "Commercial loans grew 9% in 2022, with most of the growth in the first half of the year. Higher inventory levels contributed to increased working capital needs, which drove higher utilization rates. However, utilization rates stabilized in the second half of the year, and current data is not pointing to additional inventory builds, which indicates most businesses are carefully managing inventory levels amid slowing demand.\n",
      "We continue to closely monitor the most pandemic-impacted sectors and inflation-sensitive industries in our commercial portfolio. This includes:\n",
      "Updating underwriting guidelines to include interest-rate\n",
      "sensitivity to leveraged loans\n",
      "ii\n",
      "Analyzing supply chain issues, inflationary pressures, and the\n",
      "impact of a potential recession\n",
      "The Commercial Real Estate office market is showing signs of weakness due to lower demand, driving higher vacancy rates and deteriorating operating performance. Challenging economic and capital market conditions are also buffeting the office market, and while we haven’t seen this translate to significant loss content yet, we do expect to see stress over time and are proactively working with borrowers to manage our exposure. Specifically, we have issued underwriting guidance for navigating current conditions, including limited tolerance for new credit policy exceptions, increasing minimum debt yield thresholds, and stress testing and expansion of the watchlist process, including additional emphasis on the office market.\n",
      "Looking ahead to the remainder of 2023, we are prepared for a range of scenarios. As a large lender to both consumers and businesses in the United States, we have significant credit exposure across our businesses, and as the Federal Reserve continues to take action to reduce inflation, we will continue to monitor both the markets and our own customer data and will react accordingly. If our view of economic stress deteriorates from our view at the end of 2022, we will likely add to credit loss reserves during 2023.\n",
      "Moving forward on our risk, control, and regulatory agenda We continue to move forward with the foundational work of building out a risk and control framework appropriate for our company. This multi-year journey continues to be about setting clear priorities, cultural change, and operational execution. I have been clear and consistently reinforce that this foundational work is our top priority. This should always be the case for a bank such as ours, but this has not always been the case, so reinforcement is necessary. We remain confident in our ability to complete this work and build appropriate risk, control, and operational excellence into our culture.\n",
      "The Acting Comptroller of the Currency gave an important speech in January addressing the potential difficulties of managing a large bank. Given that the OCC is a key supervisor of ours, we take the speech seriously and are focused on its key messages.\n",
      "The speech focused on the view that there are limits to an organization’s manageability based on size and, if so, that the most efficient and effective way to fix this is to compel its simplification. I am not in a position to agree or disagree with this premise, but I am in a position to have the strong point of view that Wells Fargo is not too big or complex to manage. Our shortcomings are not structural, but they are the result of historically ineffective management and the lack of proper prioritization of building out an appropriate risk and control environment that will ultimately take multiple years to correct.\n",
      "We are large but are far less complex than many with whom we compete. In fact, we have more similarities with regional banks than other global systemically important banks (GSIBs), and strong and effective risk management processes should scale to a company of our size. In addition, we have acted and will continue to act on our own to simplify our company and reduce operational complexity and risk, as I detail in the section later in this letter entitled “Executing on Strategic Objectives.”\n",
      "Operating at a broad scale but with less complexity than peers\n",
      "1. We are primarily a US domestic bank and we do not have the many complexities that running large-scale international businesses bring. Our legal entity structure, extent of international regulatory oversight and physical footprint are far simpler than many of our competitors. Approximately 90% of our revenues come from U.S. clients or activities of non-U.S. clients in the U.S. Our businesses outside the U.S. primarily support our U.S. customer base. We are very happy with our existing footprint and are not looking beyond for growth opportunities. 2. Our products are not complex compared with those offered by other banks and are similar to those offered by smaller institutions. We predominantly provide the same products and services as regional and smaller, more local banks. We take deposits, provide financing, move money, and provide financial advice for our customers. Our trading activities and the size of our market risk are relatively small compared to other large GSIBs. 3. Scale in each of our businesses should not make us more complex. Our distribution methods are similar to smaller institutions. We manage a branch network, have relationship managers across our markets, market through the internet, traditional advertising, direct mail, and word of mouth, and we rely on our local reputation. The controls necessary to manage a network of 4,000+ branches are similar to those necessary to manage a smaller branch network. The same is true for managing relationship managers, marketing, and protecting our reputation. Senior management should be involved at a detailed level, but all institutions should have and rely on defined control frameworks in place that are effective at risk management, regardless of individuals in a seat. These frameworks can effectively scale to a bank of our size. 4. Our customers benefit from our size and reach. Wells Fargo has nearly 4,600 retail bank branches, with a presence in 25 of the largest 30 markets in the U.S. A Wells Fargo branch or ATM is within 2 miles of over half of U.S. Census households and small businesses in our footprint. The range of banking services we provide helps us build full relationships with individuals and companies, allowing us to see a full picture of their personal, family, and/or business financial needs, and to meet these needs. We have the ability to invest in technology to make it faster, safer, and\n",
      "more transparent for our customers to handle their banking needs. In addition, our resources allow us to innovate quickly, developing new products, services, and digitized experiences to meet constantly changing consumer and business expectations. These capabilities, along with our size and reach, are of tangible benefit to consumers across the country, whether they live in large cities or more rural areas, and also to the U.S. economy as a whole.\n",
      "Managing the company with significantly heightened discipline\n",
      "We agree that there are also traits that management should avoid as they grow. These signs are familiar to us, as we identified them as historical behaviors at Wells Fargo when I arrived. We viewed them then – as we do now – as unacceptable. Our approach today is dramatically different than it was at Wells Fargo in the past and we will continue to work so it becomes part of our culture at all levels in the organization.\n",
      "1. Don’t hide behind materiality – As a large institution we know we cannot let our size hide potential issues. We must think about raw numbers, not just percentages which are indexed to a large customer base, asset base, or capital base. We have built functions and processes to review customer complaints, employee allegations, and issues raised from outside the company, and aim to use them to identify issues and themes so we can address them and make changes as required. 2. Don’t assume incidents are isolated – One of the advantages large institutions have is the amount of data and information we see and have, but we must use it expeditiously. Individual incidents provide data points which can help us learn and react, and we should treat each as such. We strive to make data-driven decisions and to explore whether incidents that can appear isolated can in fact have broader application elsewhere in the company. 3. Identify weaknesses ourselves and address them quickly – The Acting Comptroller stated that “the business of banking is operationally intensive. Even at banks with strong teams and robust risk management systems and controls, mistakes and problems can arise. Well-managed banks identify such problems early and often, address them quickly, and take steps to prevent their recurrence.” We agree completely. Many of the historical issues we continue to work through were identified by regulators, not by us. We are changing this, emphasizing our responsibility to self-identify more issues and address them with a heightened sense of urgency. As we implement our risk and control framework, we will likely identify more issues and move with haste to implement compensating and ultimately permanent controls. Our risk and control framework is not a project, but an ongoing set of actions, and it will be part of our culture. 4. Hubris, contempt, and indifference are unacceptable and dangerous traits – We cannot believe that we know better\n",

      "than others and need to react with seriousness and urgency when issues are raised – whether from employees, customers, regulators, or others outside the company. Every issue raised has the opportunity to be a learning moment and we should also proactively look at our competitors to learn as well. Integration of mergers is more than a short-term technology conversion – While we have not had a merger- related systems integration in my time at Wells Fargo, we agree that “simply stitch[ing]…systems together” can cause a proliferation of issues. It is critical to merge and simplify platforms, whether merger-related or as part of a customer service strategy, as the reduced complexity in the number of platforms should make it easier to properly serve customers. For example, asking customer-service representatives to learn multiple systems to provide the same information creates more operational risk and the possibility of a poor customer experience. But these platform mergers should be the beginning of integration, not the end. This is true looking both from our perspective and the customer perspective. Customers think of us as one company, not as separate relationships with individual lines of business. They want to see their information seamlessly and be able to transact with us easily across all of their products. Unless we integrate our platforms, we will either not appear as one company to the customer, or we will create workarounds to try and accomplish this, which creates unneeded operational risk. A major competitive advantage of Wells Fargo is serving our customers across a broad range of products, but we can only do so effectively with common platforms. The same is true of data platforms. Pulling customer data from multiple platforms is operationally complex and expensive. Common data platforms across our company are critical. We rely on this for financial reporting, regulatory reporting, risk reporting, and the ability to assess a customer relationship holistically. And finally, it is a mistake to lose sight of aged platforms, to not invest in improving them and to not move to new ones. New software and hardware solutions make it easier to reduce complexity and properly serve customers, and when these solutions are part of a program with a clear target state, they should significantly reduce operational complexity. Recognizing this, Wells Fargo is implementing a modern technology stack that is cloud-native and therefore more elastic and resilient. We are applying this stack for the various product domains that we are modernizing across our businesses. Examples include a more modern digital desktop for our financial advisors in Wealth and Investment Management, our value-at-risk models in Corporate and Investment Banking, and our payment platforms across businesses. These modernization initiatives are guided top-down by a product and platform architecture that sets\n",
      "5.\n",
      "iv\n",
      "clear boundaries and expectations for teams. In addition to this, the hosting of our platforms is more and more migrating to a combination of private and public cloud, powered by our partnerships with Google and Microsoft. This also is leading to faster innovation by plugging in innovative services provided by these cloud providers into our platforms. In parallel to these modernization efforts, we are also enhancing the way we deliver software and the developer experience. We are implementing new cloud-native tool- chains that allow our developers to have the experience that they deserve: on-demand, instant, elastic and with embedded automated controls.\n",
      "Further taking stock of where we stand – why haven’t we completed our risk and regulatory work\n",
      "I am frequently asked why our risk and regulatory work is not complete though we have been publicly reprimanded, have a growth constraint, and I have been leading the company for over 3 years. I wish my job was merely to complete work that was well underway, but unfortunately this was not the case. Simply said, the work to build the appropriate risk and control infrastructure and close consent orders takes years when managed effectively, and we were not as far along as I had expected when I arrived. Much work was needed to build what is necessary to properly accomplish the work.\n",
      "When I arrived, we did not have the culture, effective processes, or appropriate management oversight in place to remediate weaknesses on a timely basis. Today, we approach these issues differently. This management team (the broad team – not just me) has the skills and experience and is now responsible for closing our consent orders. We have changed and implemented much to put ourselves in a position to have the confidence that we can accomplish this. The specifics of our regulatory remediation plans are confidential, and while we are not where we need to be, I believe that our position is significantly improved and that we will reach our goals. We are committed to making all necessary resources available to meet our obligations.\n",
      "I have said we are a different company today, and in this sub-section, I provide some examples.\n",
      "1. When I arrived at the company in 2019, we had 12 open, public enforcement actions. Given this and the other control issues we needed to assess, it took many months to understand the depth and breadth of the weaknesses and what was required to complete the work. 2. We then went about recruiting a mostly new management team with the experience and skills that we did not sufficiently have at the company. A large portion of the Operating Committee was recruited during 2020 and they then needed to do their own assessments and develop plans. They then needed several years to build out their teams.\n",
      "3. For each consent order Matters Requiring Attention (MRAs), and other control gaps identified, we needed to build detailed plans that satisfied both us and our regulators. Our plans are now detailed and have hundreds of deliverables with designated delivery dates. Many of our consent orders have work that relies on work from another order, so any slippage on one plan can impact another. Our ability to assess all of this accurately for work to be done over multiple years has not been perfect, and we have missed some deliverables, but we have learned, adjusted, and continue to move forward. 4. We needed to build processes to manage these across the company. Building reporting and setting up management review structures for these activities has been critical to moving the work forward. Most of these did not exist or were ineffective, and we now believe we have much more effective reporting and processes in place to provide appropriate oversight and allow us to identify issues early so we can course-correct. 5. We did not have the resources necessary to accomplish this work when I arrived. We have added close to 10,000 people across numerous risk- and control-related groups and have spent approximately $2 billion more in 2022 than in 2018 in these areas. We are committed to make the investments needed to complete the work. 6. And we had to build the management disciplines and culture to govern and execute such a large body of work. Our Operating Committee reviews risk and regulatory progress and escalations on a weekly basis. We provide detailed reporting to the full board and appropriate committees so they can provide oversight. These reviews are systematic and detailed, and they are helping us provide the appropriate oversight and involvement to accomplish the work.\n",
      "I should add that we had to do all of this during the very worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. While we were not alone in dealing with the complexities of work from home, social distancing and meeting the needs of customers during a pandemic, we were alone in what we had to build, and doing so in a remote working environment increased the difficulty level significantly.\n",
      "Some have suggested that banks view enforcement actions and fines as a cost of doing business, but I can tell you that today, nothing is further from the truth at Wells Fargo. We view any such action by our regulators as something that requires immediate management attention. We aim both to avoid the necessity of such action by doing the work ourselves and, when regulators do take enforcement action against us, we follow a disciplined process to work towards closure, again with all necessary resources available for the effort.\n",
      "The negative impact on our reputation of having not fulfilled our obligations is clear. Simply put, failure to satisfy our regulatory requirements carries significant consequences for our company. On the other hand, fulfilling our obligations and building an\n",
      "appropriate risk and control framework will allow us to build a strong reputation amongst a broad set of stakeholders. So why do we have so many consent orders that have been open for extended periods? Again, our historical practices were inadequate, and it has taken time to build what is necessary to change our historical inadequacies.\n",
      "So as I look at our situation today, the failure of Wells Fargo to complete its work appropriately has resulted in multiple consent orders, fines, and an asset cap. But I can say confidently that we have taken significant actions including focusing and simplifying the company, refreshing the board, replacing most of the senior management team, and are now moving forward to correct past deficiencies. We have the willingness and the ability to complete the work.\n",
      "And to be clear, we are committed to prioritizing this work above all else by devoting all necessary resources to the effort. Our planning is designed to ensure other activities do not interfere with this top priority. If we have a conflict, our risk and control work comes first.\n",
      "I have said our progress will likely not be a straight line. We continue to resolve issues that were found years ago or are the result of the inadequate control environment that existed when we arrived at the company. This means that resolution of outstanding issues such as litigation, customer remediations or regulatory investigations have and could continue to have financial impacts. Additionally, until our work is complete, we will likely find new issues that need to be remediated, and these may result in additional regulatory actions.\n",
      "Finally, as we continue to execute on our detailed plans, given the scope and complexity of our work, we may miss some interim milestones. We recognize the importance of meeting milestones that we ourselves set, but perfection is unlikely. When we discover an issue, we act quickly to course-correct and do what we can to get back on schedule. This is frustrating for us and others outside the company but is not indicative of our willingness or ability to complete our work. Rather, it is an obstacle that presents itself in nearly any large-scale, multi-year transformation.\n",
      "When Wells Fargo faces criticism about where we stand, I understand the sentiment. I hope this section has provided detailed context and is helpful in providing an understanding of what we are doing to close our gaps. This team is taking decisive action to move our company past these issues.\n",
      "Leadership Team Key to transforming the company, changing our culture, and realizing the full strength of our franchise is having the best management team in place. Since I joined the company in 2019, 12 of our 17 Operating Committee members are new to Wells Fargo and 15 are new to their roles. In 2022, we put in place a new Chief Auditor, a new Chief Risk Officer, a new head of Consumer Lending, and a new head of Diverse Segments, Representation and Inclusion.\n",
      "2022 Annual Report\n",
      "We continue to refresh our management ranks more broadly. Over 80% of our senior executive leaders – a group of approximately 150 people, most of whom report to Operating Committee members – are new to their roles since 2019, and nearly 60% are new to the company over the same time period. Over 30% of the individuals in this senior executive cohort began in new roles in 2022 or 2023. New leaders who have joined over the past several years bring important experience that is necessary for our journey.\n",
      "Executing on Strategic Objectives\n",
      "Simplifying our business\n",
      "We continue to review the strategic positioning of the company and are focusing our efforts on building products and services that are core to serving our clients. This focus has led us to decisions to sell, downsize, or curtail multiple businesses. These decisions simplify the company, reduce operational complexity and risk, and allow us to focus on both our core risk and control buildout and ways to serve our customers in our core franchises. There are several examples since I joined the company in 2019.\n",
      "In January 2023, we announced plans to simplify our Home Lending business and will primarily serve bank and wealth management customers as well as borrowers in minority communities. As part of this shift, we announced our plans to exit the Correspondent business, reduce the size of our Servicing portfolio, and optimize our Retail team so it aligns with our narrower customer focus. These actions will allow us to reduce risk in the Home Lending business while continuing making homeownership possible to thousands of Americans. Over the past year, we have taken several additional steps to simplify the way we operate. For instance, we have: • Implemented a cloud-native operating model which will enable us to reduce reliance on older, less stable platforms and allows us to innovate faster • Centrally organized our Control Management teams, to enable better coordination across our businesses • Streamlined our divisional leadership in Wells Fargo Advisors, moving from eight regional divisions to four • Combined Treasury Services platforms across Commercial Banking and Corporate and Investment Banking Looking further back to 2021, 2020, and 2019, we have: • Sold Wells Fargo Asset Management • Sold our Corporate Trust Services business • Sold our student lending portfolio and stopped the origination of new student loans • Exited our international wealth management segment • Sold our Canadian direct equipment finance business\n",
      "vi\n",
      "Stopped offering new home equity lines and loans\n",
      "• Exited the direct Auto business • Stopped originating personal lines of credit • Sold our Institutional Retirement and Trust business • In addition, over the past several years, we have closed over a dozen representative offices globally to better focus our international business, including offices in Asia, Europe, South America, the Middle East, and elsewhere.\n",
      "• In addition, over the past several years, we have closed over a dozen representative offices globally to better focus our international business, including offices in Asia, Europe, South America, the Middle East, and elsewhere. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate our businesses with an eye toward reducing complexity, increasing risk-adjusted returns, and focusing our resources on the most important products and services our customers require. Market dynamics change, the competitive environment changes, regulatory expectations evolve and we must adjust our business accordingly.\n",
      "Focusing on customer needs and expectations\n",
      "Each of our businesses is working to transform how we serve our customers by offering focused, innovative products and solutions. Many of the initiatives underway reduce risk in the company and we evaluate new initiatives to consider the potential impact on our control environment. Some examples are below.\n",
      "Our Consumer Businesses: Consumer and Small Business Banking, Consumer Lending, and Wealth and Investment Management\n",
      "• We rolled out our new consumer mobile app with a simpler, more intuitive user experience which has improved customer satisfaction. We also completed the development of Fargo, our new AI-powered virtual assistant, which provides a more personalized, convenient, and simple consumer banking experience. Fargo is currently live for eligible employees and is set to begin rolling out to customers during the first half of this year. Providing such digitized services directly to our customers reduces operational complexity in our service centers and increases customer satisfaction. • We continued to improve our credit card offerings including launching two new cards – Wells Fargo Autograph and BILT. While we describe these as new products, these are actually updated products in a business we have been in for many years. • We launched Wells Fargo Premier, our new offering dedicated to the financial needs of affluent clients by bringing together our branch-based and wealth-based businesses to provide a more comprehensive, relevant, and integrated offering for our clients. • We also relaunched Intuitive Investor in our Wealth and Investment Management segment, making it easier for customers to invest with a streamlined account opening process and a lower minimum investment.\n",
      "Our Wholesale Businesses: Commercial Banking and Corporate and Investment Banking\n",
      "• We have made several hires in Corporate and Investment Banking that have received some press. These hires are in industries we currently serve and products we currently offer, but the individuals bring new expertise to Wells Fargo. • We continued to enhance the partnership within our commercial businesses to bring Corporate and Investment Banking products such as foreign exchange and M&A advisory services to our middle-market corporate clients. • In December we announced Vantage, an enhanced digital experience for our commercial and corporate clients. Vantage uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide a tailored and intuitive platform based on our clients’ specific needs. • Over the past year our industry-leading API platform team continued the development of payment APIs for commercial and corporate clients, invested in solutions to support our financial institution clients, ramped-up and grew product offerings in consumer lending, and began developing commercial lending solutions.\n",
      "Evolving our approach to technology\n",
      "Technology is helping us better serve our consumer and corporate clients. Our technology talent is modernizing platforms for our customers, clients and colleagues. Specific areas of focus are:\n",
      "• A cross-product pricing platform\n",
      "• Digitization of our lending origination platforms across Small Business, Commercial and Corporate Banking • Continued modernization of our Treasury Services and Payments platforms • Strengthening our technological capabilities in fraud prevention • Modernizing key corporate risk platforms • Refreshing our Auto loans platform\n",
      "These enhanced digital capabilities are just the start of the initiatives we have planned as part of our multi-year digital transformation.\n",
      "Seeing early returns from this work\n",
      "Our work to build better, more customer-focused products and a more technology-enabled company is generating measurable returns. For instance:\n",
      "• In Consumer and Small Business Banking, mobile active customers grew 4% from a year ago. • The new credit cards I mentioned above helped drive a 31% increase in new credit card accounts in 2022, and we’ve continued to maintain strong credit profiles. The average\n",
      "FICO score of our new accounts in 2022 was 773, compared to 761 for the 2019 vintage. • In Wealth and Investment Management, total active Intuitive Investor accounts increased 56% from a year ago. • Our U.S. investment banking market share was 3.2% in 2022, up 61 basis points versus 2021. We had the #7 ranking in this year’s U.S. investment banking league tables, up two spots from 2021. • As a company, we deliver many solutions nowadays in sprints, reducing our through-put time by as much as 60% compared to 2020.\n",
      "ESG, communities and customer centricity As I look back at 2022, I’m enthusiastic about the progress we’ve made in serving our communities and our customers, and I feel even better about the opportunities ahead.\n",
      "Let me start with the changes we made during the year to help millions of customers avoid overdraft fees and meet short-term cash needs. These efforts included:\n",
      "The elimination of non-sufficient funds fees and transfer fees\n",
      "for customers enrolled in Overdraft Protection. • Early Pay Day, making eligible direct deposits available up to two days early. • Extra Day Grace, giving eligible customers an extra business day to make deposits to avoid overdraft fees. • And in the fourth quarter we launched Flex Loan, a new digital-only, small-dollar loan that provides eligible customers convenient and affordable access to funds. Teams from across the company came together to roll out this new product in just a few months. Though it’s still early, customer response is exceeding our expectations.\n",
      "The above actions build on services we’ve introduced over the past several years, including Clear Access Banking, a consumer banking account with no overdraft fees. We now have over 1.7 million of those accounts, up 48% from a year ago.\n",
      "Beyond our customers, we have an important responsibility to strengthen the communities we serve. We continued that work in 2022. This was true on several fronts.\n",
      "Supporting homeownership\n",
      "• We launched a Special Purpose Credit Program in 2022, committing $150 million to advance racial equity in homeownership, with an additional $100 million investment towards this racial equity effort announced in 2023. • We established Wealth Opportunities Restored through Homeownership, or WORTH, a $60 million national effort to address systematic barriers to homeownership for people of color. Nationally, WORTH aims to help create 40,000 new homeowners of color in eight markets by the end of 2025\n",
      "2022 Annual Report\n",
      "vii\n",
      "• We announced an expansion of our Dream.Plan.Home closing cost credit, which provides borrowers with an income at or below 80% of the area median income where the property is located up to $5,000 to use toward closing costs. The credit is available in 16 states and in Washington, DC. • We announced Growing Diverse Housing Developers, a $40 million grant initiative focused on expanding the growth and success of real estate developers of color, including Black- and Latino-owned firms.\n",
      "Banking inclusion\n",
      "• As part of our Banking Inclusion Initiative, we launched our first Community Connections Branch outside Atlanta, with more to come. These branches offer spaces for financial health seminars and individual consultations. • Also as part of our Banking Inclusion Initiative, we announced plans with Operation HOPE to introduce HOPE Inside centers in 20 markets. HOPE Inside Centers feature financial coaches who will help empower community members to achieve their financial goals through financial education and free one-on-one coaching. To date, we’ve launched these centers in the Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, Oakland and Phoenix metro regions. • Since its launch in 2022, our Small Business Resource Navigator has connected nearly 1,300 small businesses to potential credit opportunities and technical assistance services provided by CDFIs.\n",
      "Climate initiatives\n",
      "• We announced interim greenhouse gas reduction targets for the Oil & Gas and Power sectors. • We issued our second Inclusive Communities and Climate Bond, a $2 billion bond that will finance projects and programs supporting housing affordability, economic opportunity, renewable energy and clean transportation.\n",
      "In addition, we have made significant progress on our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives. These are detailed in our first Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion annual report, which we published last summer. We continue to push forward on our commitment to integrating DE&I across the company, and, as part of this commitment, we have commissioned an external, third-party Racial Equity Assessment. We plan to publish the results of the assessment by the end of this year.\n",
      "I’m proud of all this work. We are balanced in our approach to environmental, social and governance issues, and, as I wrote a year ago, we believe that for us to be successful as a company, we must consider a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions, beyond shareholders. This is not in lieu of shareholders – in fact we believe it will enhance our returns to shareholders over time. Our history has shown this to be true. Consumers and businesses want to do business with a company that has a strong reputation. A strong reputation is achieved not\n",
      "viii\n",
      "just from strong financial performance, but from actively supporting employees, customers, and communities – especially those most in need.\n",
      "As we look forward I remain confident in our company. The franchise we have is enviable and will become increasingly more so as we transform the company. We have done much and we must finish the risk and control work I’ve described in a timeframe and with the quality to satisfy our regulators to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us, so this will remain our top priority.\n",
      "We will do this while we navigate what will likely be a tricky economic environment. 2022 was a turning point in the cycle and the impact of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases have not been fully seen in the economy yet. Though we are starting to see the impact on consumer spend, credit, housing, and demands for goods and services, it is still early. Thus far, the impact to consumers and businesses has been manageable.\n",
      "Though there will certainly be some industries and segments of consumers that are more impacted than others, the rate of impact we see in our customer base is not materially accelerating. This plus the strength with which consumers and businesses went into this slowing economy is a helpful set of facts as we look forward.\n",
      "While we are not predicting a severe downturn, we must be prepared for one and we are a stronger company today than 1 and 2 years ago. We have actively managed our capital position and focused on efficiency. Our margins are wider, our returns are higher, we are better managed, and our capital position is strong. While we will be impacted by a downturn in the economic cycle, we feel prepared for a downside scenario if we see broader deterioration than we currently see or predict.\n",
      "We still have clear opportunities to improve our performance as we make progress on our efficiency initiatives. We will invest as necessary in our risk and control infrastructure, we will modernize our existing platforms, and we will continue to make the investments necessary serve our customers through service, technology and product enhancements.\n",
      "I want to conclude by thanking our employees across the company who are working hard each day to continue to make progress on our transformation. The pressure they feel to accomplish our work is immense and the dedication that I see is unmatched. I’m thankful for all that they do and remain committed to leading us towards the goal of being the most respected financial institution in the country.\n",

The Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other regulatory actions, which may require the Company, among other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, operations, products and services, and risk management practices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to take multiple years, and we are likely to experience issues or delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. Issues o r delays with one regulatory action could affect our progress on others, and failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulator y action on a timely basis could result in additional penalties, business restrictions, enforcement actions, and other negative consequences, which could be significant. While we still have significant work to do and have not yet satisfied certain aspec of these regulatory actions, the Company is committed to devoting the resources necessary to operate with strong business practices and controls, maintain the highest level of integrity, and have an appropriate culture in place.\n",
      "Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational Risk Management On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company’s compliance and operational risk management program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the Company works to address the consent order provisions. The consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial third-party review of the enhancements and improvements\n",

Until this third-party review is complete and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined under the consent order will be limited to the level as of December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of temporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements.\n",
      "Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program and past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management of remediation activities conducted by the Company. The Company continues to work to address the provisions of the consent orders. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home Lending business. On December 20, 2022, the CFPB modified its consent order to clarify how it would terminate.\n",

The required actions related to many of these matters were already substantially complete at the time we entered into the consent order, and the consent order lays out a path to termination after the Company completes the remainder of the required actions.\n",
      "Retail Sales Practices Matters In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers received products and services they did not request. As a result, it remains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive action plan that includes making things right for our customers, employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better Company for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB consent order regarding retail sales practices expired.\n",

      "Recent Developments LIBOR Transition The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely referenced benchmark rate that seeks to estimate the cost at which banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other banks. On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced that certain settings of LIBOR would no longer be published on a representative basis after December 31, 2021, and the most commonly used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings would no longer be published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. Central banks in various jurisdictions convened committees to identify replacement rates to facilitate the transition away from LIBOR. The committee convened by the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the replacement rate for USD LIBOR. In first quarter 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the LIBOR Act) was enacted into U.S. federal law to provide a statutory framework to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on SOFR in U.S. law contracts that do not have fallback provisions or that have fallback provisions resulting in a replacement rate based on LIBOR. The FRB adopted a final rule implementing the LIBOR Act on December 16, 2022, which will become effective on February 27, 2023. We expect that the LIBOR Act will transition certain of our legacy USD LIBOR contracts that do not have appropriate fallback provisions to the applicable SOFR-based replacement rates specified in the FRB’s final rule.\n",
      "We no longer offer new contracts referencing LIBOR, subject to limited exceptions based on regulatory guidance. During 2022, we executed certain LIBOR transition activities to enhance our operational readiness such as the development of new alternative reference rate products, model and system updates, and employee training.\n",
      "For certain contracts, including commercial credit facilities and related derivatives, we continue to proactively engage with our clients and contract parties to replace LIBOR with SOFR- based rates or other alternative reference rates in advance of the June 30, 2023 cessation date.\n",

      "We have accrued for the probable and estimable costs related to our customer remediation activities, which amounts may change based on additional facts and information, as well as ongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. As our ongoing reviews continue and as we continue to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure, we have identified and may in the future identify additional items or areas of potential concern. To the extent issues are identified, we will continue to assess any customer harm and provide remediation as appropriate. We have previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of these activities.\n",

      "total revenue decreased due to lower net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income, partially offset by higher net interest income; provision for credit losses increased reflecting loan growth and a less favorable economic environment; noninterest expense increased due to higher operating losses, partially offset by lower personnel expense, and professional and outside services expense; average loans increased driven by loan growth across both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios; and average deposits decreased driven by reductions in Corporate and Investment Banking, Commercial Banking, Wealth and Investment Management, and Corporate, partially offset by growth in Consumer Banking and Lending.\n",

Total equity of $181.9 billion at December 31, 2022, decreased compared with $190.1 billion at December 31, 2021, driven by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income due to net unrealized losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities.

This decrease was partially offset by loan growth and a less favorable economic environment. Our provision for credit losses for loans was $1.5 billion in 2022, compared with $(4.2) billion in 2021, reflecting loan growth and a less favorable economic environment. The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.42% at December 31, 2022, compared with 1.54% at December 31, 2021. Commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were $79 million, or 1 basis point of average commercial loans, in 2022, compared with net loan charge-offs of $295 million, or 6 basis points, in 2021, driven by lower losses in our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate mortgage portfolios. Consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were $1.5 billion, or 39 basis points of average consumer loans, in 2022, compared with net loan charge-offs of $1.3 billion, or 33 basis points, in 2021, predominantly due to higher losses in our auto portfolio.

      "Operating Segment Results Our management reporting is organized into four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in Corporate. For additional information, see segments by type of product and customer segment, and their results are based on our management reporting process. The management reporting process measures the performance of the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed with our Chief Executive management. The management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenu and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management to assess performance consistently across the operating segments.\n",
      "Funds Transfer Pricing Corporate treasury manages a funds transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or credits is recognized in corporate treasury.\n",
      "Revenue and Expense Sharing When lines of business jointly serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of\n",

      "When a line of business uses a service provided by another line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the service provided.\n",
      "Taxable-Equivalent Adjustments Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable- equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low- income housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated financial results.\n",
      "Allocated Capital Reportable operating segments are allocated capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are periodically assessed and revised. Management believes that return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it enables management, investors, and others to assess a reportable operating segment’s use of capital.\n",
      "Selected Metrics We present certain financial and nonfinancial metrics that management uses when evaluating reportable operating segment results. Management believes that these metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable operating segments or lines of business.\n",

For additional information, see Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report.\n",
      "Unfunded Credit Commitments Unfunded credit commitments are legally binding agreements to lend to customers with terms covering usage of funds, contractual interest rates, expiration dates, and any required collateral. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will generally be lower than the contractual amount because these commitments may expire without being used or may be cancelled at the customer’s request. Our credit risk monitoring activities include managing the amount of commitments, both to individual customers and in total, and the size and maturity structure of these commitments. For additional information, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.\n",

      "Risk is Part of our Business Model. Risk is the possibility of an event occurring that could adversely affect the Company’s ability to achieve its strategic or business objectives. The Company routinely takes risks to achieve its business goals and to serve its customers. These risks include financial risks, such as interest rate, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and non-financial risks, such as operational risk, which includes compliance and model risks, and strategic and reputation risks.\n",
      "Risk Profile. The Company’s risk profile is an assessment of the aggregate risks associated with the Company’s exposures and business activities after taking into consideration risk management effectiveness. The Company monitors its risk profile, and the Board reviews risk profile reports and analysis.\n",
      "Risk Capacity. Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk that the Company could assume given its current level of resources before triggering regulatory and other constraints on its capital and liquidity needs.\n",
      "Risk Appetite. Risk appetite is the amount of risk, within its risk capacity, the Company is comfortable taking given its current level of resources. Risk appetite is articulated in our Statement of Risk Appetite, which establishes acceptable risks and at what level and includes risk appetite principles. The Company’s Statement of Risk Appetite is defined by senior management, approved at least annually by the Board, and helps guide the Company’s business and risk leaders. The Company continuously monitors its risk appetite, and the Board reviews reports which include risk appetite information and analysis.\n",
      "Risk is Managed by Everyone. Every employee, in the course of their daily activities, creates risk and is responsible for managing risk. Every employee has a role to play in risk management, including establishing and maintaining the Company’s control environment. Every employee must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and Company policies.\n",
      "Risk and Culture. Senior management sets the tone at the top by supporting a strong culture, defined by the Company’s expectations, that guides how employees conduct themselves and make decisions. The Board oversees senior management in establishing and maintaining this culture and effectively managing risk. Senior management expects employees to speak up when they see something that could cause harm to the Company’s customers, communities, employees, shareholders, or reputation. Because risk management is everyone’s responsibility, all employees are empowered to and expected to challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their concerns when they have not been addressed. The Company’s performance management and incentive compensation programs are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk and reward under core principles that employees are expected to know and practice. The Board, through its Human Resources Committee, plays an important role in overseeing and providing credible challenge to the Company’s performance management and incentive compensation programs. Effective risk management is a central component of employee performance evaluations.\n",
      "Risk Management Framework. The Company’s risk management framework sets forth the Company’s core principles for managing and governing its risk. It is approved by the Board’s Risk Committee and reviewed and updated annually. Many other documents and policies flow from its core principles.\n",
      "Risk and Strategy. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) drives the Company’s strategic planning process, which identifies the Company’s most significant opportunities and challenges, develops options to address them, and evaluates the risks and trade-offs of each. The Company’s risk profile, risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness are considered in the strategic planning process, which is linked with the Company’s capital planning process. The Company’s Independent Risk Management (IRM) organization participates in strategic planning, providing challenge to and independent assessment of the risks associated with strategic initiatives. IRM also independently assesses and challenges the impact of the strategic plan on risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness at the principal lines of business, enterprise functions, and aggregate Company level. After review, the strategic plan is presented to the Board each year with IRM’s evaluation.\n",

The Company is committed to helping mitigate the impacts of climate change related to its activities and to partner with key stakeholders, including communities and customers, to do the same. The Company expects that climate change will increasingly impact the risk types it manages, and the Company will continue to integrate climate considerations into its risk management framework as its understanding of climate change and risks driven by it evolve.\n",

As of December 31, 2022, a significant portion of the lines of credit in a draw period used the interest-only option. The lines that enter their amortization period may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the ones in their draw or term period. We have considered this increased risk in our ACL for loans estimate. Interest-only lines and loans were approximately 2% and 3% of total loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n",
      "During the draw period, the borrower has the option of converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only payments for a fixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing payment with a fixed period between five to 30 years. At the end of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 30 years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment increase, which can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the outstanding balance.\n",

In addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential mortgage loans that are then used to back securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). We may be required to repurchase these mortgage loans, indemnify the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans (collectively, repurchase) in the event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of the breach.\n",

See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses.\n",
      "We provide recourse to GSEs for commercial mortgage loans sold under various programs and arrangements. The terms of these programs require that we incur a pro-rata share of actual losses in the event of borrower default. See Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our exposure to loss related to these programs.\n",
      "In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial mortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed mortgage securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label mortgage securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors.\n",
      "The loans we service were originated by us or by other mortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are typically to (1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest on the mortgage loans, (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans, (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of\n",
      "taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments, and (5) foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the related servicing agreement, consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short sales, and for certain investors, manage the foreclosed property through liquidation. As master servicer, our primary duties are typically to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of the mortgage loans by the servicer, and (2) advance delinquent amounts required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform their advancing obligations. The amount and timing of reimbursement for advances of delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable servicing agreements. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about residential and commercial servicing rights, servicer advances and servicing fees. In accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, upon transfer as servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which generally becomes exercisable when three scheduled loan payments remain unpaid by the borrower. We generally repurchase these loans for cash and as a result, our total consolidated assets do not change. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, these repurchased loan balances were $9.8 billion and $17.3 billion, respectively, which included $8.6 billion and $12.9 billion, respectively, in loans held for investment, with the remainder in loans held for sale.\n",
      "Repurchased loans that regain current status or are otherwise modified in accordance with applicable servicing guidelines may be included in future GNMA loan securitization pools. However, in accordance with guidance issued by GNMA, certain loans repurchased after June 30, 2020, are ineligible for inclusion in future GNMA loan securitization pools until the borrower has timely made six consecutive payments. This requirement may delay our ability to transfer loans into the securitization market. See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our involvement with mortgage loan securitizations.\n",
      "Each agreement under which we act as servicer or master\n",
      "servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions we take in such capacity. We are required to indemnify the securitization trustee against any failure by us, as servicer or master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations. In addition, if we commit a breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period. The standards governing servicing in GSE-guaranteed securitizations, and the possible remedies for violations of such standards, vary, and those standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides maintained by the GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and individual servicers and topical guides published by the GSEs from time to time. Such remedies could include indemnification or repurchase of an affected mortgage loan. In addition, in connection with our servicing activities, we could become subject to consent orders and settlement agreements with federal and state regulators for alleged servicing issues and practices. In general, these can require us to provide customers with loan modification relief, refinancing relief, and foreclosure prevention and assistance, and can result in business restrictions or the imposition of certain monetary penalties on us. For example, on September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business.

Primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk Committee of the Board.\n",

      "INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk is the risk that market fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange can cause a loss of the Company’s earnings and capital stemming from mismatches in the Company’s asset and liability cash flows primarily arising from customer-related activities such as lending and deposit-taking. We are subject to interest rate risk because: • assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts; short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs differently; the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, mortgage-related products may pay down at a slower rate than anticipated, which could impact portfolio income; or interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage origination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other financial instruments.\n",
      "Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or lower interest rates. Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit mix is modeled to be the same in the base scenario and the alternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, customer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher yielding products could impact expected net interest income. The interest rate sensitivity of deposits is modeled using the historical behavior of our deposits portfolio and reflects the expectations of deposit products repricing as market interest rates change (referred to as deposit betas). Our actual experience in base and alternative scenarios may differ from expectations due to the lag or acceleration of deposit repricing, changes in consumer behavior, and other factors.\n",

See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to- Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information on the debt securities portfolios. We use derivatives for asset/liability management in two main ways: • to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability instruments/portfolios including investments, commercial loans and long-term debt, from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments, or vice versa; and to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, funded mortgage loans, and MSRs.\n",

However, an increase in interest rates can also reduce mortgage loan demand, including refinancing activity, which reduces noninterest income from origination activities. A decline in interest rates would generally have an opposite impact. To reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, our residential MSRs are economically hedged with a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, Eurodollar futures, highly liquid mortgage forward contracts and interest rate options. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires sophisticated modeling and constant monitoring. There are several potential risks to earnings from mortgage banking related to origination volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and associated hedging results, the relationship and degree of volatility between short-term and long-term interest rates, and changes in servicing and foreclosures costs. While we attempt to balance our mortgage banking interest rate and market risks, the financial instruments we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income being hedged.\n",

We determine whether mortgage loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for investment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability management activities. We may also retain securities in our investment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates may impact mortgage banking noninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and the fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan commitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage applicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our mortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to the time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer demand, as well as the time required for processing a new application, providing the commitment, and securitizing and selling the loan.

The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding companies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. In addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to establish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing financial distress. Furthermore, to promote a BHC’s safety and soundness and the financial and operational resilience of its operations, the FRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of directors of large BHCs and has proposed related guidance identifying core principles for effective senior management. The OCC, under separate authority, has finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The guidelines also formalize roles and responsibilities for risk management practices within covered banks and create certain risk oversight responsibilities for their boards of directors. In addition to\n",
      "the authorization of enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms, the Dodd- Frank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research, which may recommend new systemic risk management requirements and require new reporting of systemic risks. Regulation of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to ensure that consumers receive clear and accurate disclosures regarding financial products and are protected from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB has issued a number of rules impacting consumer financial products, including rules regarding the origination, servicing, notification, disclosure and other requirements with respect to residential mortgage lending, as well as rules impacting prepaid cards, credit cards, and other financial products and banking-related activities. In addition to these rulemaking activities, the CFPB is continuing its ongoing supervisory examination activities of the financial services industry with respect to a number of consumer businesses and products, including mortgage lending and servicing, fair lending requirements, and auto finance. Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities. The Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter derivatives, and, pursuant to authority granted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have adopted comprehensive sets of rules regulating swaps and security-based swaps, respectively, and the OCC and other federal regulatory agencies have adopted margin requirements for uncleared swaps and security-based swaps. As a provisionally- registered swap dealer and a conditionally-registered security-based swap dealer, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is subject to these rules. These rules, as well as others adopted or under consideration by regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions, may negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new derivatives or amendments to existing derivatives, and may increase our costs for engaging in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives activities.\n",

      "“Living Will” Requirements and Related Matters Rules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank , to Act require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo prepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known a s “living wills,” that would facilitate their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failu Under the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates th e risk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States. In addition to the Company’s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary, e Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), is also required to prepar and periodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FD IC determine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requiremen on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until w e adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets o operations. On November 23, 2022, the FRB and FDIC announced that the Company’s most recent resolution plan did not have any shortcomings or deficiencies.\n",
      "If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly liquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically important financial institution that is in default or in danger of default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is appointed as receiver for the Parent, then the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ claims.\n",
      "desirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly liquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is possible.\n",
      "To facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important financial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal banking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an orderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, 2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC (“WFCS”), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated from time to time as material entities for resolution planning purposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified from time to time as related support entities in our resolution plan (the “Related Support Entities”). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including the majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and intercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its subsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will continue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered Entities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity and/ or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were not implemented. The respective obligations under the Support Agreement of the Parent, the IHC, the Bank, and the Related Support Entities are secured pursuant to a related security agreement.\n",
      "The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings.

      "Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report) are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition because they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies govern: • • • • • • the allowance for credit losses; the valuation of residential MSRs; the fair value of financial instruments; income taxes; liability for contingent litigation losses; and goodwill impairment. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies and the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit Committee. Allowance for Credit Losses We maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management’s estimate of the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt securities classified as either HTM or AFS, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. For loans and HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured based on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset (including off-balance sheet credit exposures) adjusted, as appropriate, for prepayments and permitted extension options using historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted information. For AFS debt securities, the ACL is measured using a discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost. Changes in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision for credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the judgment and review required to determine the ACL, management considerations include the evaluation of past events, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and conditions, customer behavior, collateral values, the length of the initial loss forecast period, and other influences. From time to time, changes in economic factors or assumptions, business strategy, products or product mix, or debt security investment strategy, may result in a corresponding increase or decrease in our ACL. While our methodology attributes portions of the ACL to specific financial asset classes (loan and debt security portfolios) or loan portfolio segments (commercial and consumer), the entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of the Company. • Judgment is specifically applied in: Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast period. We forecast a wide range of economic variables to estimate expected credit losses. Our key economic variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate,\n",
      "and collateral asset prices. While many of these economic variables are evaluated at the macro-economy level, some economic variables are forecasted at more granular levels, for example, using the metro statistical area (MSA) level for unemployment rates, home prices and commercial real estate prices. At least annually, we assess the length of the initial loss forecast period and have currently set the period to two years. For the initial loss forecast period, we forecast multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more pessimistic (downside) scenarios. Management exercises judgment when assigning weight to the economic scenarios that are used to estimate future credit losses. Reversion to historical loss expectations. Our long-term average loss expectations are estimated by reverting to the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the forecasted economic variables. These long-term averages are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis. Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, unfunded credit commitments, and debt securities. Individually assessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit variables in our modeled approaches to help assess probability of default and loss given default. Borrower quality ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial strength and contribute to forecasted probability of default curves. Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted collateral prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted severity of loss in the event of default. These credit risk ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers and subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk specialists. Usage of credit loss estimation models. We use internally developed models that incorporate credit attributes and economic variables to generate credit loss estimates. Management uses judgment and quantitative analytics in the determination of segmentation, modeling approach, and variables that are leveraged in the models. These models are independently validated in accordance with the Company’s policies. We routinely assess our model performance and apply adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy of loss estimation. We also assess our models for limitations against the company-wide risk inventory to help appropriately capture known and emerging risks in our estimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as needed. Valuation of collateral. The current fair value of collateral is utilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial asset is considered to be collateral dependent. We apply judgment when valuing the collateral either through appraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or other quantitative techniques. Decreases in collateral valuations support incremental charge-downs and increases in collateral valuation are included in the ACL as a negative allowance when the financial asset has been previously written-down below current recovery value. Contractual term considerations. The remaining contractual term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We extend the contractual term when we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension\n",

We also incorporate any scenarios where we reasonably expect to provide an extension through a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). indeterminate maturities, which requires that we determine a contractual life by estimating the application of future payments to the outstanding loan amount. Qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models. These amounts represent management’s judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the ACL. We also consider economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. Credit card loans have Sensitivity The ACL for loans is sensitive to changes in key assumptions which requires significant management judgment. Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a variety of ty, factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quali and general forecasted economic conditions. The forecasted t economic variables used could have varying impacts on differen financial assets or portfolios. Additionally, throughout numero us s credit cycles, there are observed changes in economic variable such as the unemployment rate, GDP and real estate prices whic may not move in a correlated manner as variables may move in opposite directions or differ across portfolios or geography. h Our sensitivity analysis does not represent management’s view of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date. We applied a 100% weight to a more severe downside scenario in our sensitivity analysis to reflect the potential for further economic deterioration. The outcome of the scenario was influenced by the duration, severity, and timing of changes in economic variables within the scenario. The sensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the ACL for loans of approximately $7.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The hypothetical increase in our ACL for loans does not incorporate the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the current ACL for loans, which may have a positive or negative effect on the results. It is possible that others performing similar sensitivity analyses could reach different conclusions or results. The sensitivity analysis excludes the ACL for debt securities and other financial assets given its size relative to the overall ACL. Management believes that the estimate for the ACL for loans was appropriate at the balance sheet date.\n",

The discount rate used to present value estimated future net servicing income. The discount rate is the required rate of return investors in the market would expect for an asset with similar risk. To determine the discount rate, we consider the risk premium for uncertainties in the cash flow estimates such as from servicing operations (e.g., possible changes in future servicing costs, ancillary income and earnings on escrow accounts). In 2022, we enhanced our approach for estimating the discount rate to a more dynamic methodology for market curves and volatility.

For example, an increase in either the prepayment rate or discount rate assumption results in a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in either assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of the MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market- driven fluctuations in loan prepayment rate and the discount rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the future. Additionally, future regulatory or investor changes in servicing standards as well as changes in individual state foreclosure legislation or changes in market participant information regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an impact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation in future periods.

However, when observable market data is limited or not available, fair value estimates are typically determined using internal models based on unobservable inputs. Internal models used to determine fair value are validated in accordance with Company policies by an internal model validation group.

Determination of these assumptions includes consideration of many factors, including market conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value. In such cases, it may be appropriate to adjust available quoted prices or observable market data. For example, we may adjust a price received from a third-party pricing service using internal models based on discounted cash flows when the impact of illiquid markets has not already been incorporated in the fair value measurement. Additionally, for certain residential LHFS and certain debt and equity securities where the significant inputs have become unobservable due to illiquid markets and a third- party pricing service is not used, our discounted cash flow model uses a discount rate that reflects what we believe a market participant would require in light of the illiquid market.\n",

Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits.\n",
      "Deferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet method and deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and recognizes enacted changes in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur.

For such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if we cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low end of the range of those potential losses.

The most significant impact of adoption relates to reinsurance of variable annuity products for a limited number of our insurance clients. Our reinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts. These variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum benefits that require us to make benefit payments for the remainder of the policyholder’s life once the account values are exhausted. These guaranteed minimum benefits meet the definition of market risk benefits and are measured at fair value.\n",
      "At adoption, the effect of the difference between fair value and the carrying value of our market risk benefits, net of income tax adjustments and excluding the impact of our own credit risk, was approximately $325 million as of January 1, 2023. The adjustment increased our retained earnings and regulatory capital amounts and ratios. The adjustment for the impact of our own credit risk recorded as an increase to other comprehensive income was approximately $15 million, net of tax, as of January 1, 2023. We expect future earnings volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits, which are sensitive to changes in equity and fixed income markets, as well as policyholder behavior and changes in mortality assumptions.

The Update will impact the measurement of the ACL for loans and require new enhanced disclosures related to loan modifications and credit quality, specifically the Update: • • Eliminates TDR disclosures and requires new disclosures for modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other than insignificant payment delay, term extension, or a combination of these modifications. • Requires us to provide current period gross charge-offs by origination date (vintage) in our credit quality disclosures on a prospective basis beginning as of the adoption date.\n",

      "A weakening in business or economic conditions, including higher unemployment levels or declines in home prices, as well as higher interest rates, can also adversely affect our customers’ ability to repay their loans or other obligations, which can negatively impact our credit performance. If unemployment levels worsen or if home prices fall we would expect to incur elevated charge-offs and provision expense from increases in our allowance for credit losses. These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer loan performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially for those business borrowers that rely on the health of industries that may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The ability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans may deteriorate, causing us, as one of the largest commercial and CRE lenders in the U.S., to incur significantly higher credit losses. In addition, weak or deteriorating economic conditions make it more challenging for us to increase our consumer and commercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy borrowers at attractive yields. Furthermore, weak economic conditions, as well as competition and/or increases in interest rates, could soften demand for our loans resulting in our retaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid assets on our consolidated balance sheet.

For example, because investment advisory fees are often based on the value of assets under management, a fall in the market prices of those assets could reduce our fee income. Changes in stock market prices could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing commissions and other fees we earn from our brokerage business. In addition, adverse market conditions may negatively affect the performance of products we have provided to customers, which may expose us to legal actions or additional costs. Poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial markets also can negatively affect our debt and equity underwriting and advisory businesses, as well as our venture capital business and trading activities, including through heightened counterparty credit risk.

The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy; disrupted global supply chains; affected equity market valuations; and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets and unemployment levels. As a result of the pandemic, the demand for our products and services has, at times, been significantly impacted, which adversely affected our revenue.

Depending on future developments, the COVID-19 pandemic or any new pandemic could result in the occurrence of new, unanticipated adverse effects on us or the recurrence of adverse effects similar to those already experienced.\n",
      "Changes in interest rates and financial market values could reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, including as a result of recognizing losses on the debt and equity securities that we hold in our portfolio or trade for our customers. Changes in either our net interest margin or the amount or mix of earning assets we hold, including as a result of the asset cap under the February 2018 consent order with the FRB, could affect our net interest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can affect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. If our funding costs rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets or if the yield we earn on our assets falls faster than our funding costs, our net interest margin could contract.\n",
      "The amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect our yield and net interest income. We hold earning assets in the form of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets. As noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our yield and net interest income. In addition, our net interest income and net interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged period of low interest rates as it may result in us holding lower yielding loans and securities on our consolidated balance sheet, particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher yielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. Increases in interest rates, however, may continue to negatively affect loan demand and could result in higher credit losses as borrowers may have more difficulty making higher interest payments. As described below, changes in interest rates also affect our mortgage business, including the value of our MSRs. In an effort to address high inflation, the FRB significantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate and has indicated it may continue to raise it in 2023.\n",

We may hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate derivatives. We also rely on the “natural hedge” that our mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can provide as their revenue impact tends to move in opposite directions based on changes in interest rates.\n",
      "We generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There is always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or option volatility could reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve changes, we may incur significant losses on debt securities we hold as investments. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may rebalance our portfolios of debt securities, equity securities and loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic actions. We may incur losses when we take such actions. In addition, changes in interest rates can result in increased basis risk, which could limit the effectiveness of our hedging activities.\n",
      "Because of changing economic and market conditions, as well as credit ratings, affecting issuers and the performance o f any underlying collateral, we may be required to recognize othe than-temporary impairment (OTTI) in future periods on the securities we hold. Furthermore, the value of the debt securiti we hold can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates, issuer creditworthiness, and other factors. Our net income also is exposed to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices in connection with our trading activities, which are conducted primarily to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers, as well as when we execute economic hedging to manage certain balance sheet risks.

When the yield curve flattens or inverts, our net interest income and net interest margin could decrease if the cost of our short-term funding increases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-term assets.

      "The transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Additionally, federal banking regulators issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using USD LIBOR in new contracts. We have a significant number of assets and liabilities, such as legacy commercial loans, adjustable-rate mortgage loans, derivatives, debt securities, and long-term debt, referenced to LIBOR and other interbank offered rates. When any such benchmark rate or other referenced financial metric is significantly changed, replaced or discontinued, or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market benchmark rate or financial metric, there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instrument.\n",
      "This could impact the financial performance of previously booked transactions, result in losses on financial instruments we hold, require different hedging strategies or result in ineffective or increased basis risk on existing hedges, impact the overall interest rate environment and the availability or cost of floating- rate funding, affect our capital and liquidity planning and management, or have other adverse financial consequences. There can be no assurance that any new benchmark rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or other financial metric will be an adequate alternative to LIBOR or produce the economic equivalent of LIBOR. In addition, the transition away from LIBOR will continue to require changes to existing transaction data, products, systems, models, operations, and pricing processes, as well as the modification or renegotiation of contracts that reference USD LIBOR. It may also continue to result in significant operational, systems, or other practical challenges, increased compliance and operational costs, and heightened expectations and scrutiny from regulators, and could result in litigation, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences. Furthermore, the transition away from widely used benchmark rates like LIBOR could result in customers or other market participants challenging the determination of their interest payments, disputing the interpretation or implementation of fallback provisions and other transition related changes, or entering into fewer transactions or postponing their financing needs, which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business.

      "Effective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business, and our financial results and condition could be materially adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liquidity. We primarily rely on customer deposits to be a low-cost and stable source of funding for the loans we make and the operation of our business. In addition to customer deposits, our sources of liquidity include certain debt and equity securities, our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets and to pledge loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and the FRB, and our ability to raise funds in domestic and international money through capital markets.\n",
      "Our liquidity and our ability to fund and run our business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruption and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or our inability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Market disruption and volatility could impact our credit spreads, which are the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of the same maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads could significantly increase our funding costs. Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect our liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in the Company or negative news about the Company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets; our inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; disruptions or volatility in the repurchase market which also may increase our short-term funding costs; regulatory requirements or restrictions; unexpectedly high or accelerated customer draws on lines of credit; and, as described below, reductions in one or more of our credit ratings. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which we have little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. For example, concerns over geopolitical issues, commodity and currency prices, as well as global economic conditions, may cause financial market volatility.\n",

      "As noted above, we rely heavily on customer deposits for our funding and liquidity. We compete with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may increase, either because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive other investment opportunities, such as stocks, bonds, or money market mutual funds, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. When customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we may lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and negatively affecting our liquidity. In addition, we may continue to reduce certain deposit balances in order to manage under the asset cap.\n",

It receives substantially all of its funding and liquidity from dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries. We generally use these dividends and distributions, among other things, to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal on our debt.

Reductions in one or more of our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow funds and raise the costs of our borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect our ability to raise funding. Credit ratings and credit ratings agencies’ outlooks are based on the ratings agencies’ analysis of many quantitative and qualitative factors, such as our capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of our earnings, rating agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support, and other rating agency specific criteria. In addition to credit ratings, our borrowing costs are affected by various other external factors, including market volatility and concerns or perceptions about the financial services industry generally. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our credit ratings and outlooks and that credit ratings downgrades in the future would not materially affect our ability to borrow funds and borrowing costs.

Thi outcome may arise whether the Company is resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority, and whether the resolution is conducted using a single point of entry strategy or using a multiple poin entry strategy, in which the Parent and one or more of its subsidiaries would each undergo separate resolution proceedings. Furthermore, in a single point of entry or multipl point of entry strategy, losses at some or all of our subsidiar could be transferred to the Parent and borne by the Parent’s security holders.

If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly liquidation authority,” which allows for the appointment of the FDIC as receiver. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ claims.\n",

The Company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by federal banking regulators. In particular, the Company is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. These capital rules, among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal banking regulators have also imposed a leverage ratio and a supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs like Wells Fargo and our insured depository institutions. The FRB has also finalized rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt a U.S. G-SIB must hold to improve its resolvability and resiliency, often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC).

The OCC, under separate authority, has also established heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks, such as the Bank. The Basel standards and federal regulatory capital, leverage, liquidity, TLAC, capital planning, and other requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases, and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, including due to changes in regulatory requirements, such as through the adoption or implementation of new or revised Basel standards, or as a result of business growth, acquisitions or a change in our risk profile, could require us to liquidate assets or otherwise change our business, product offerings and/or investment plans, which may negatively affect our financial results. Although not currently anticipated, new capital requirements and/or our regulators may require us to raise additional capital in the future.

The FRB regulates the supply of money in the United States. Its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest income and net interest margin. The FRB’s interest rate policies also can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold, such as debt securities and MSRs. In addition, its policies can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in FRB policies, including its target range for the federal funds rate or actions taken to increase or decrease the size of its balance sheet, are beyond our control and can be hard to predict. The FRB significantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate and has indicated it may continue to raise it in 2023 to address high inflation. As noted above, changes in the interest rate environment and yield curve which may result from the FRB’s actions could negatively affect our net interest income and net interest margin.\n",

      "effect on our results of operations and financial condition. When we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., the credit performance of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results and condition. We also incur credit risk in connection with trading and other activities. As noted above, if the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers and counterparties may have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio (including unfunded credit commitments). The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions, including falling home prices, higher unemployment or inflation, significant loan growth, changes in consumer behavior, or other market conditions that adversely affect borrowers, or other factors. Additionally, the regulatory environment or external factors, such as natural disasters, disease pandemics, political or social matters, or trade policies, also can influence recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and impact our allowance for credit losses.\n",
      "Future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic conditions. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2022, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses. In the event of significant deterioration in economic conditions or if we experience significant loan growth, we may be required to build reserves in future periods, which would reduce our earnings. For additional information, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” sections in this Report.\n",
      "We may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral. Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or to borrowers who individually or as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions. Similarly, challenging economic or market conditions, or trade policies, affecting a particular industry or geography may also impact related or dependent industries or the ability of borrowers living in such affected areas or working in such industries to meet their financial obligations. We experienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010 when we incurred greater than expected losses in our residential real estate loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater than expected deterioration in residential real estate values in many markets, including the Central Valley California market and several Southern California metropolitan statistical areas. As California is our largest banking state in terms of loans and deposits, deterioration in real estate values and underlying economic conditions in those markets or elsewhere in California could result in materially higher credit losses.

Moreover, deterioration in macro-economic conditions generally across the country could result in materially higher credit losses, including for our residential real estate loan portfolio, which includes nonconforming mortgage loans we retain on our balance sheet. We may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates as our consumer real estate secured lines of credit reach their contractual end of draw period and begin to amortize.\n",

Furthermore, enhancements and upgrades to our infrastructure or operating systems may be time-consuming, entail significant costs, and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process of enhancing our infrastructure and operating systems, including their security measures and controls, can itself create a risk of system disruptions and security issues. Similarly, we may not be able to timely recover critical business processes or operations that have been disrupted, which may further increase any associated costs and consequences of such disruptions. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place to help provide operational resiliency, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers. For example, on February 7, 2019, we experienced system issues caused by an automatic power shutdown at one of our main data center facilities. Although applications and related workloads were systematically re-routed to back-up data centers throughout the day, certain of our services, including our online and mobile banking systems, certain mortgage origination systems, and certain ATM functions, experienced disruptions that delayed service to our customers.\n",

      "A cyber attack or other information security incident could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or reputation. Information security risks for large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet, mobile devices, and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, the increase in remote work arrangements, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Those parties also may continue to attempt to misrepresent personal or financial information to commit fraud, obtain loans or other financial products from us, or attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose confidential, proprietary, or other information to gain access to our data or that of our customers. Geopolitical matters, such as the conflict in Ukraine, may also elevate the risk of an information security threat, particularly by foreign state-sponsored parties or their supporters. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our banking, brokerage, investment advisory, and capital markets businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, hardware, and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Our technologies, systems, software, networks, and our customers’ devices continue to be the target of cyber attacks or other information security threats, which could materially adversely affect us, including as a result of fraudulent activity, the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or the disruption of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ or other third parties’ business operations. For example, various retailers have reported they were victims of cyber attacks in which large amounts of their customers’ data, including debit and credit card information, was obtained. In these situations, we generally incur costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent transaction activity affecting our customers. We are also exposed to the risk that an employee or other person acting on behalf of the Company fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures and inappropriately circumvents information security controls for personal gain or other improper purposes.\n",

For example, Wells Fargo and other financial institutions, as well as our third-party service providers, continue to be the target of various evolving and adaptive information security threats, including cyber attacks, malware, ransomware, other malicious software intended to exploit hardware or software vulnerabilities, phishing, credential validation, and distributed denial-of-service, in an effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions, test their cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also focused on targeting online applications and services, such as online banking, as well as cloud-based and other products and services provided by third parties, and have targeted the infrastructure of the internet, causing the widespread unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As a result, information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and systems designed to protect our networks, computers, software and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for Wells Fargo. We are also proactively involved in industry cybersecurity efforts and working with other parties, including our third-party service providers and governmental agencies, to continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency to information security threats. As these threats continue to evolve, we expect to continue to be required to expend significant resources to develop and enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Because the investigation of any information security breach is inherently unpredictable and would require time to complete, we may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a breach, which may further increase any associated costs and consequences.

The inability to develop effective operational controls or to foster the appropriate culture in each of our lines of business, including the inability to align performance management and compensation to achieve the desired culture, could adversely impact the effectiveness of our risk management framework. Similarly, if we are unable to effectively manage our business or operations, we may be exposed to increased risks or unexpected losses. We process a large number of transactions each day and are exposed to risks or losses if we do not accurately or completely execute a process or transaction, whether due to human error or otherwise; if we are unable to detect and prevent fraudulent activity; or if an employee or third-party service provider fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures, inappropriately circumvents controls, or engages in other misconduct.\n",
      "damages or other remedies related to these retail sales practices. The Company has entered into various settlements to resolve these investigations and proceedings, as a result of which we have incurred monetary penalties, costs, and business restrictions. If we are unable to meet any ongoing obligations under these settlements, we may incur additional monetary or other penalties or be required to make admissions of wrongdoing and comply with other conditions, which can lead to restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or services, limitations on our ability to access capital markets, limitations on capital distributions, the loss of customers, and/or other adverse consequences. Any inability to meet our ongoing obligations under these settlements, depending on the sanctions and remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, negative publicity or public opinion resulting from these matters may increase the risk of reputational harm to our business, which can impact our ability to keep and attract customers, affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, result in the loss of revenue, or have other material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.\n",
      "In certain instances, we rely on models to measure, monitor\n",
      "and predict risks, such as market, interest rate, liquidity and credit risks, as well as to help inform business decisions; however, there is no assurance that these models will appropriately or sufficiently capture all relevant risks or accurately predict future events or exposures. Furthermore, certain of our models are subject to regulatory review and approval, and any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations could result in fines, penalties, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities, or other adverse consequences, and any required modifications or changes to these models can impact our capital ratios and requirements and result in increased operational and compliance costs. In addition, we rely on data to aggregate and assess our various risk exposures and business activities, and any issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data, including our aggregation, management, and validation procedures, could result in ineffective risk management practices, business decisions or customer service, inefficient use of resources, or inaccurate regulatory or other risk reporting. We also use artificial intelligence to help further inform or automate our business decisions and risk management practices, but there is no assurance that artificial intelligence will appropriately or sufficiently replicate certain outcomes or human assessment or accurately predict future events or exposures. Previous financial and credit crises and resulting regulatory reforms highlighted both the importance and some of the limitations of managing unanticipated risks, and our regulators remain focused on ensuring that financial institutions, and Wells Fargo in particular, build and maintain robust risk management policies and practices. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\n",
      "We may be exposed to additional legal or regulatory proceedings, costs, and other adverse consequences related to retail sales practices and instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. Various government entities and offices have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations arising out of certain retail sales practices of the Company that were the subject of settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney announced by the Company on September 8, 2016, and various non-governmental parties filed lawsuits against us seeking\n",

For example, we have identified certain issues related to past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and certain issues related to the unused portion of guaranteed automobile protection waiver or insurance agreements. The identification of such areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm could lead to, and in some cases has already resulted in, additional remediation costs, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance and other costs, reputational damage, or other adverse consequences.\n",

We maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. However, we are subject to heightened compliance and regulatory oversight and expectations, particularly due to the evolving and increasingly complex regulatory landscape we operate in. We are also subject to consent orders and other regulatory actions that subject us to various conditions and restrictions. In addition, a single event or issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions. Similarly, regulators may be more likely to pursue investigations or proceedings against us to the extent that we are or have previously been subject to other regulatory actions. Also, the laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate may be different or even conflict with each other, such as differences between U.S. federal and state law or differences between U.S. and non-U.S. laws as to the products and services we may offer or other business activities we may engage in, which can lead to compliance difficulties or issues.

Moreover, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were systems and procedures in place at the time designed to ensure compliance. For example, we are subject to regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) that prohibit financial institutions from participating in the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain non-U.S. countries and designated nationals of those countries. OFAC may impose penalties or restrictions on certain activities for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the violations. Any violation of these or other applicable laws or regulatory requirements, even if inadvertent or unintentional, or any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations, including any failure to satisfy the conditions of any consent orders or other regulatory actions, could result in significant fees, penalties, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities, reputational harm, loss of customers, or other negative consequences.\n",

      "Wells Fargo and other financial institutions have been targeted from time to time by protests and demonstrations, which have included disrupting the operation of our retail banking locations, and have been subject to negative public commentary, including with respect to the fees charged for various products and services. Wells Fargo and other financial institutions have also been subject to negative publicity as a result of providing or reducing financial services to or making investments in industries or organizations subject to stakeholder concerns. There can be no assurance that continued protests or negative public opinion of the Company specifically or large financial institutions generally will not harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n",
      "Reputational harm, including as a result of our actual or alleged conduct or public opinion of the financial services industry generally, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Reputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business and has increased substantially because of our size and profile in the financial services industry, sales practices related matters, and instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. Negative public opinion about the financial services industry generally or Wells Fargo specifically could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to keep and attract customers. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including sales practices; mortgage, auto or other consumer lending practices; loan origination or servicing activities; mortgage foreclosure actions; management of client accounts or investments; lending, investing or other business relationships; identification and management of potential conflicts of interest from transactions, obligations and interests with and among our customers; environmental, social and governance practices; regulatory compliance; risk management; incentive compensation practices; and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection or improper use of customer information, and from actions taken by government regulators and community or other organizations in response to that conduct. Although we have policies and procedures in place intended to detect and prevent conduct by employees and third-party service providers that could potentially harm customers or our reputation, there is no assurance that such policies and procedures will be fully effective in preventing such conduct. Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our business or operations could result in significant reputational harm. In addition, because we conduct most of our businesses under the “Wells Fargo” brand, negative public opinion about one business also could affect our other businesses.

Difficulties in executing a divestiture may cause us not to realize any expected cost savings or other benefits from the divestiture, or may result in higher than expected losses of employees or harm our ability to retain customers. The divestiture or winding down of certain businesses or assets may also result in the impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets related to those businesses or assets.\n",

The integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, an increase in our compliance costs or risk profile, disruption of our business or the acquired business, or otherwise harm our ability to retain customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.

Climate change related impacts could also negatively affect the financial condition of our customers, increase the credit risk associated with those customers, or result in the deterioration of the value of the collateral we hold. In addition, changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions on account of climate considerations or due to the transition to a low carbon economy may adversely affect customers in certain industries, sectors or geographies, which may increase our credit risk and reduce the demand by these customers for our products and services. Furthermore, the transition to a low carbon economy could affect our business practices or result in additional costs or other adverse consequences to our business operations. Legislation and/or regulation in connection with climate change, as well as stakeholder perceptions and expectations related to climate change and its impacts, could require us to change certain of our business and/or risk management practices, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our operations and business. Moreover, our reputation may be damaged as a result of our response to climate change or our strategy for the transition to a low carbon economy, including if we are unable or perceived to be unable to achieve our objectives or if our response is disliked, disfavored, or perceived to be ineffective or insufficient.

      "Our mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to quarter, including from the impact of changes in interest rates, and we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming loans to reduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to fund new mortgage loans. We earn revenue from fees we receive for originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates can affect these fees, as well as the fair value of our MSRs. When rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from loan originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our MSRs can increase due to a decline in the likelihood of prepayments, which increases the fair value of our MSRs. When rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase and the value of our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with some offsetting revenue effect. Even though they can act as a “natural hedge,” the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing.\n",
      "We typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge our mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. Hedging is not a perfect science, and we could incur significant losses from our hedging activities.\n",
      "We rely on the GSEs to purchase mortgage loans that meet their conforming loan requirements and on government insuring agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to insure or guarantee loans that meet their policy requirements. If the GSEs or government insuring agencies were to limit or reduce their purchasing, insuring or guaranteeing of loans, our ability to fund, and thus originate, new mortgage loans, could be reduced. We cannot assure that the GSEs or government insuring agencies will not materially limit their purchases, insuring or guaranteeing of conforming loans or change their criteria for what constitutes a conforming loan (e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower eligibility). As noted above, there are various proposals to reform the housing finance market in the U.S., including the role of the GSEs in the housing finance market. The impact of any such regulatory reform regarding the housing finance market and the GSEs, as well as any effect on the Company’s business and financial results, are uncertain. In addition, to meet customer needs, we also originate loans that do not conform to either the GSEs’ or government insuring agencies’ standards, which are generally retained on our balance sheet and therefore do not generate sale proceeds that could be used to originate new loans.\n",

We establish a mortgage repurchase liability that reflects management’s estimate of losses for loans for which we have a repurchase obligation. Because the level of the liability depends on economic factors and other external conditions, the level of the liability is difficult to estimate, requires considerable management judgment, and is subject to change.

      "We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n",
      "Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n",
      "A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n",
      "Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n",

We provide banking, investment and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, through banking locations and offices, the internet and other distribution channels to individuals, businesses and institutions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in countries outside the U.S. When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells Fargo & Company (the Parent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding company. We also hold a majority interest in a real estate investment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock outstanding.\n",
      "Our accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in the financial services industry. To prepare the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make estimates based on assumptions about future economic and market conditions (for example, unemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, income and expenses during the reporting period and the related disclosures. Although our estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Management has made significant estimates in several areas, including: •\n",

Prior to ASU 2016-02, variable lease payments were excluded from the definition of lease payments for lessors measuring their net investment loss in a sales-type lease or direct financing lease. This often resulted in a day 1 loss, even if the lessor expected the arrangement to be profitable overall. We adopted this Update prospectively in first quarter 2022.

When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse the accrued unpaid interest receivable against interest income and suspend amortization of any net deferred fees. If the ultimate collectability of the recorded loan balance is in doubt on a nonaccrual loan, the cost recovery method is used and cash collected is applied to first reduce the carrying value of the loan to zero and then as a recovery of prior charge-offs. Otherwise, interest income may be recognized to the extent cash is received. Generally, we return a loan to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal become current under the terms of the loan agreement and collectability of remaining principal and interest is no longer doubtful. We may re-underwrite modified loans at the time of a restructuring to determine if there is sufficient evidence of sustained repayment capacity based on the borrower’s financial strength, including documented income, debt to income ratios and other factors. If the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms and the underwriting process shows the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will generally remain in accruing status. When a loan classified as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) performs in accordance with its modified terms, the loan either continues to accrue interest (for performing loans) or will return to accrual status after the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance (generally six consecutive months of payments, or equivalent, inclusive of consecutive payments made prior to the modification). Loans will be placed on nonaccrual status and a corresponding charge-off is recorded if the re-underwriting did not include an evaluation of the borrower’s ability to repay or we believe it is probable that principal and interest contractually due under the modified terms of the agreement will not be collectible.\n",

These modified terms may include interest rate reductions, principal forgiveness, term extensions, payment forbearance and other actions intended to minimize our economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, if applicable. For modifications where we forgive principal, the entire amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately charged off. If the underwriting for a TDR modification did not include an evaluation of the borrower’s ability to repay, the loan is deemed collateral dependent.

Long-term average loss expectations estimated by reverting to the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the economic variables forecasted during the initial loss forecast period. These long-term averages are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis.\n",
      "The remaining contractual term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We extend the contractual term when we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension options.

For financial assets with an ACL estimated using DCF methods, changes in the ACL due to the passage of time are recorded in interest income. The ACL for AFS debt securities reflects the amount of unrealized loss related to expected credit losses, limited by the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis (fair value floor) and cannot have an associated negative allowance.\n",

      "For financial assets that are collateral-dependent, we will measure the ACL based on the fair value of the collateral. If we intend to sell the underlying collateral, we will measure the ACL based on the collateral’s net realizable value. In most situations, based on our charge-off policies, we will immediately write-down the financial asset to the fair value of the collateral or net realizable value. For consumer loans, collateral-dependent financial assets may have collateral in the form of residential real estate, autos or other personal assets. For commercial loans, collateral-dependent financial assets may have collateral in the form of commercial real estate or other business assets.\n",

Accrued interest receivables are included in other assets, except for certain revolving loans, such as credit card loans.\n",
      "CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY For consumer loans, we determine the allowance using a pooled approach based on the individual risk characteristics of the loans within those pools. Quantitative modeling methodologies that estimate probability of default, loss severity at the time of default and exposure at default are typically leveraged to estimate expected loss. These methodologies pool loans, generally by product types with similar risk characteristics, such as residential real estate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. As appropriate and to achieve greater accuracy, we may further stratify selected portfolios by sub-product, risk pool, loss type, geographic location and other predictive characteristics. We use attributes such as delinquency status, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, and loan-to-value ratios (where applicable) in the development of our consumer loan models, in addition to home price trends, unemployment trends, and other economic variables that may influence the frequency and severity of losses in the consumer portfolio.\n",
      "OTHER QUALITATIVE FACTORS The ACL includes amounts for qualitative factors which may not be adequately reflected in our loss models. These amounts represent management’s judgment of risks in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the ACL. Generally, these amounts are established at a granular level below our loan portfolio segments. We also consider economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments.\n",

For off- balance sheet credit exposures, we recognize an ACL associated with the unfunded amounts. We do not recognize an ACL for commitments that are unconditionally cancelable at our discretion. Additionally, we recognize an ACL for financial guarantees that create off-balance sheet credit exposure, such as loans sold with credit recourse and factoring guarantees. ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures are reported as a liability in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\n",
      "COMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO S L METHODOLOGY Generally, commercial loans, which include net investments in lease financing, are assessed for estimated losses by grading each loan using various risk factors as identified through periodic reviews. Our estimation approach for the commercial portfolio reflects the estimated probability of default in accordance with the borrower’s financial strength and the severity of loss in the event of default, considering the quality of any underlying collateral. Probability of default, loss severity at the time of default, and exposure at default are statistically derived through historical observations of default and losses after default within each credit risk rating. These estimates are adjusted as appropriate for risks identified from current and forecasted economic conditions and credit quality trends.

Many of these financial assets are generally not expected to have an ACL as there is a zero loss expectation (e.g., government guarantee) based on no historical credit losses and consideration of current and forecasted conditions.

PCD assets include HTM and AFS debt securities and loans. PCD assets are recorded at their purchase price plus an ACL estimated at the time of acquisition. Under this approach, there is no provision for credit losses recognized at acquisition; rather, there is a gross-up of the purchase price of the financial asset for the estimate of expected credit losses and a corresponding ACL recorded. Changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for credit losses in subsequent periods. In general, interest income recognition for PCD financial assets is consistent with interest income recognition for the similar non-PCD financial asset.\n",

We identify the reporting units based on how the segments and reporting units are managed, taking into consideration the economic characteristics, nature of the products and services, and customers of the segments and reporting units. We allocate goodwill to applicable reporting units based on their relative fair value at the time we acquire a business and when we have a significant business reorganization. If we sell a business, a portion of goodwill is included with the carrying amount of the divested business.\n",

If we perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to test for impairment and conclude it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is greater than its carrying amount, quantitative tests are not required. However, if we determine it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, we complete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is goodwill impairment. We apply various quantitative valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow and earnings multiple approaches, to determine the estimated fair value, which is compared with the carrying value of each reporting unit. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized if the fair value is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill. The goodwill impairment loss is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We recognize impairment losses as a charge to other noninterest expense and a reduction to the carrying value of goodwill. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment are prohibited.\n",

We assess hedge effectiveness using regression analysis, both at inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. For fair value hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing the periodic change in fair value of the hedging instrument against the periodic changes in fair value of the asset or liability being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). For cash flow hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing the periodic changes in fair value of the hedging instrument against the periodic changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative. The hypothetical derivative has terms that identically match and offset the cash flows of the forecasted transaction being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). The initial assessment for fair value and cash flow hedges includes an evaluation of the quantitative measures of the regression results used to validate the conclusion of high effectiveness. Periodically, as required, we also formally assess whether the derivative we designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item using the regression analysis method.\n",
      "DISCONTINUING HEDGE ACCOUNTING We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (1) a derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item, (2) a derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, (3) we elect to discontinue hedge accounting, or (4) when the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring in a cash flow hedge.\n",
      "When we discontinue fair value hedge accounting, we no longer adjust the previously hedged asset or liability for changes in fair value. The remaining cumulative adjustments to the hedged item and accumulated amounts reported in OCI are accounted for in the same manner as other components of the carrying amount of the asset or liability. For example, for financial debt instruments such as AFS debt securities, loans or long-term debt, these amounts are amortized into net interest income over the remaining life of the asset or liability similar to other amortized cost basis adjustments. If the hedged item is derecognized, the accumulated amounts reported in OCI are immediately reclassified to net interest income.

      "COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK AND NETTING By using derivatives, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as expected.

The amounts reported as a derivative asset are derivative contracts in a gain position, and to the extent subject to legally enforceable master netting arrangements, net of derivatives in a loss position with the same counterparty and cash collateral received. We minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, executing master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. Counterparty credit risk related to derivatives is considered in determining fair value and our assessment of hedge effectiveness. To the extent derivatives subject to master netting arrangements meet the applicable requirements, including determining the legal enforceability of the arrangement, it is our policy to present derivative balances and related cash collateral amounts net on our consolidated balance sheet. We incorporate adjustments to reflect counterparty credit risk (credit valuation adjustments (CVA)) in determining the fair value of our derivatives. CVA, which considers the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements, reflects market-based views of the credit quality of each counterparty. We estimate CVA based on observed credit spreads in the credit default swap market and indices indicative of the credit quality of the counterparties to our derivatives.\n",

Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits.\n",

If an HPI is not available, the original appraised value is used.

Generally, we obtain available LTVs and CLTVs on a quarterly basis.

A putative securities fraud class action has also been filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that the Company and certain of its executive officers made false or misleading statements about the Company’s hiring practices related to diversity. Allegations related to the Company’s hiring practices related to diversity are also among the subjects of shareholder derivative lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.\n",
      "INTERCHANGE LITIGATION Plaintiffs representing a class of merchants have filed putative class actions, and individual merchants have filed individual actions, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and Wachovia Corporation regarding the interchange fees associated with Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. Visa, MasterCard, and several other banks and bank holding companies are also named as defendants in these actions. These actions have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The amended and consolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants based on alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and seeks damages as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege that Visa, MasterCard, and payment card issuing banks unlawfully colluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that enforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged tying and bundling of services offered to merchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along with other defendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment Sharing Agreements, which provide that they, along with other entities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses from the Interchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and the financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, signed a memorandum of understanding with plaintiff merchants to resolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate settlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions. The settlement payments to be made by all defendants in the consolidated class and individual actions totaled approximately $6.6 billion before reductions applicable to certain merchants opting out of the settlement. The class settlement also provided for the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period of eight consecutive months. The district court granted final approval of the settlement, which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector merchants. Other merchants opted out of the settlement and are pursuing several individual actions. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the settlement agreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\n",
      "New York for further proceedings. On November 23, 2016, prior class counsel filed a petition to the United States Supreme Court, seeking review of the reversal of the settlement by the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court denied the petition on March 27, 2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court appointed lead class counsel for a damages class and an equitable relief class. The parties have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the money damages class claims pursuant to which defendants will pay a total of approximately $6.2 billion, which includes approximately $5.3 billion of funds remaining from the 2012 settlement and $900 million in additional funding. The Company’s allocated responsibility for the additional funding is approximately $94.5 million. The court granted final approval of the settlement on December 13, 2019, which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector merchants. On September 27, 2021, the district court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in the equitable relief case. Several of the opt-out and direct action litigations have been settled while others remain pending.\n",
      "MORTGAGE LENDING MATTERS Plaintiffs representing a class of mortgage borrowers filed separate putative class actions alleging that Wells Fargo improperly denied mortgage loan modifications or repayment plans to customers in the foreclosure process due to the overstatement of foreclosure attorneys’ fees that were included for purposes of determining whether a customer in the foreclosure process qualified for a mortgage loan modification or repayment plan. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into settlements to resolve the class actions, while the others were voluntarily dismissed. In addition, federal and state government agencies, including the CFPB, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations regarding these and other mortgage servicing matters. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money penalty against the Company regarding loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home Lending business and insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent order. In addition, on September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business. As described above, on December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order with the CFPB to resolve the CFPB’s investigations related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending.\n",
      "NOMURA/NATIXIS MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION In August 2014 and August 2015, Nomura Credit & Capital Inc. (Nomura) and Natixis Real Estate Holdings, LLC (Natixis) filed a total of seven third-party complaints against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in New York state court. In the underlying first-party actions, Nomura and Natixis have been sued for alleged breaches of representations and warranties made in connection with residential mortgage-backed securities sponsored by them. In the third-party actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that Wells Fargo, as master servicer, primary servicer or securities administrator, failed to notify Nomura and Natixis of their own breaches, failed to properly oversee the primary servicers, and failed to adhere to accepted servicing practices. Natixis additionally alleges that Wells Fargo failed to perform default oversight duties. In March 2022, Wells Fargo entered into an agreement to settle the six actions filed by Nomura, and the actions have been voluntarily dismissed. In the remaining action filed by Natixis, Wells Fargo has asserted counterclaims alleging that Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo notice of its\n",

      "OFAC RELATED INVESTIGATION The Company has self-identified an issue whereby certain foreign banks utilized a Wells Fargo software-based solution to conduct import/export trade-related financing transactions with countries and entities prohibited by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States Department of the Treasury. We do not believe any funds related to these transactions flowed through accounts at Wells Fargo as a result of the aforementioned conduct. The Company has made voluntary self-disclosures to OFAC and has been cooperating with investigations or inquiries arising out of this matter by federal government agencies. The Company is in resolution discussions with certain of these agencies, although there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these discussions.\n",

      "mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New York and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee’s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. In July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light’s claims and certain of the claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each case in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and Commerzbank AG appealed the district court’s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Company previously settled two class actions filed by institutional investors and an action filed by the National Credit Union Administration with similar allegations. In addition, Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC have filed substantially similar lawsuits in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning of defective mortgage loan documentation.\n",
      "RETAIL SALES PRACTICES MATTERS Federal and state government agencies, including the United States Department of Justice (Department of Justice) and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations arising out of certain retail sales practices of the Company that were the subject of settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney announced by the Company on September 8, 2016. On February 21, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with the Department of Justice to resolve the Department of Justice’s criminal investigation into the Company’s retail sales practices as well as a separate agreement to resolve the Department of Justice’s civil investigation. As part of the Department of Justice criminal settlement, no charges will be filed against the Company provided the Company abides by all the terms of the agreement. The Department of Justice criminal settlement also includes the Company’s agreement that the facts set forth in the settlement document constitute sufficient facts for the finding of criminal violations of statutes regarding bank records and personal information. On February 21, 2020, the Company also entered into an order to resolve the SEC’s investigation arising out of the Company’s retail sales practices. The SEC order contains a finding, to which the Company consented, that the facts set forth include violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. As part of the resolution of the Department of Justice and SEC investigations, the Company made payments totaling $3.0 billion. The Company has also entered into agreements to resolve other government agency investigations, including investigations by the state attorneys general. In addition, a number of lawsuits were filed by non-governmental parties seeking damages or other remedies related to these retail sales practices. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into various settlements to resolve these lawsuits.\n",
      "SEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION The Seminole Tribe of Florida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that Wells Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with the administration of a minor’s trust and failed to invest the assets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended to include three individual current and former beneficiaries as plaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case. Wells Fargo filed a petition to remove the case to federal court, but the case was remanded back to state court.\n",
      "OUTLOOK As described above, the Company establishes accruals for legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and estimable losses was approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against Wells Fargo and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s consolidated financial condition. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material to Wells Fargo’s results of operations for any particular period.\n",

      "We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. We designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (fair value or cash flow hedges). Our remaining derivatives consist of economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting and derivatives held for customer accommodation trading or other purposes.\n",
      "Risk Management Derivatives Our asset/liability management approach to interest rate, foreign currency and certain other risks includes the use of derivatives, which are typically designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, or economic hedges. We use derivatives to help minimize significant, unplanned fluctuations in earnings, fair values of assets and liabilities, and cash flows caused by interest rate, foreign currency and other market risk volatility. This approach involves modifying the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates, foreign currency and other exposures, which may cause the hedged assets and liabilities to gain or lose fair value, do not have a significant adverse effect on the net interest margin, cash flows and earnings. In a fair value or economic hedge, the effect of change in fair value will generally be offset by the unrealized gain or loss on the derivatives linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. In a cash flow hedge, where we manage the variability of cash payments due to interest rate or foreign currency fluctuations by the effective use of derivatives linked to hedged assets and liabilities, the hedged asset or liability is not adjusted and the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income.\n",
      "Customer Accommodation Trading We also use various derivatives, including interest rate, commodity, equity, credit and foreign exchange contracts, as an accommodation to our customers as part of our trading businesses. These derivative transactions, which involve engaging in market-making activities or acting as an intermediary, are conducted in an effort to help customers manage their market risks. We usually offset our exposure from such derivatives by entering into other financial contracts, such as separate derivative or security transactions. These customer accommodations and any offsetting derivatives are treated as customer accommodation trading and other derivatives in our disclosures. Additionally, embedded derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately from their host contracts are included in the customer accommodation trading and other derivatives disclosures, as applicable.\n",

      "We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to fulfill fair value disclosure requirements. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, such as derivatives, residential MSRs, and trading or AFS debt securities, are presented in Table 15.1 in this Note. Additionally, from time to time, we record fair value adjustments on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or fair value (LOCOM) accounting, write-downs of individual assets or application of the measurement alternative for nonmarketable equity securities. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are presented in Table 15.4 in this Note. We provide in Table 15.9 estimates of fair value for financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, such as loans and debt liabilities carried at amortized cost.\n",
      "AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES AFS debt securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement for AFS debt securities is based upon various sources of market pricing. Where available, we use quoted prices in active markets. When instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted prices in active markets do not exist for such securities, we use prices obtained from third-party pricing services and, to a lesser extent, may use prices obtained from independent broker-dealers (brokers), collectively vendor prices. Substantially all of our AFS debt securities are recorded using vendor prices. See the “Level 3 Asset and Liability Valuation Processes – Vendor Developed Valuations” section in this Note for additional discussion of our processes when using vendor prices to record fair value of AFS debt securities, which includes those classified as Level 2 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.\n",
      "FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY We classify our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on significant unobservable inputs. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in this Report for a detailed description of the fair value hierarchy.\n",
      "In the determination of the classification of financial instruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. This determination is ultimately based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of the unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. We do not classify nonmarketable equity securities in the fair value hierarchy if we use the non-published net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to measure fair value. Marketable equity securities with published NAVs are classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n",
      "When vendor prices are deemed inappropriate, they may be adjusted based on other market data or internal models. We also use internal models when no vendor prices are available. Internal models use discounted cash flow techniques or market comparable pricing techniques.\n",
      "LOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS) LHFS generally includes commercial and residential mortgage loans originated for sale in the securitization or whole loan market. A majority of residential LHFS, and our portfolio of commercial LHFS in our trading business, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The remaining LHFS are held at LOCOM which may be written down to fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value for LHFS that are not part of our trading business is based on quoted market prices, where available, or the prices for other mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics. We may use securitization prices that are adjusted for typical securitization activities including servicing value, portfolio composition, market conditions and liquidity. Fair value for LHFS in our trading business is based on pending transactions when available. Where market pricing data or pending transactions are not available, we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value.\n",
      "Assets TRADING DEBT SECURITIES Trading debt securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. These securities are valued using internal trader prices that are subject to independent price verification procedures, which includes comparing internal trader prices against multiple independent pricing sources, such as prices obtained from third-party pricing services, observed trades, and other approved market data. These pricing services compile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing for similar securities when no price is observable. We review pricing methodologies provided by pricing services to determine if observable market information is being used versus unobservable inputs. When evaluating the appropriateness of an internal trader price, compared with other independent pricing sources, considerations include the range and quality of available information and observability of trade data. These sources are used to evaluate the reasonableness of a trader price; however, valuing financial instruments involves judgments acquired from knowledge of a particular market. Substantially all of our trading debt securities are recorded using internal trader prices.\n",

Commercial MSRs are carried at LOCOM and may be written down to fair value on a nonrecurring basis. MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. We determine the fair value of MSRs using a valuation model that estimates the present value of expected future net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants may use in estimating future net servicing income cash flows, including estimates of prepayment speeds (including housing price volatility for residential MSRs), discount rates, default rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees.\n",

We use all available information in making this determination, which includes observable transaction prices for the same or similar security, prices from third-party pricing services, broker quotes, trading multiples of comparable public companies, and discounted cash flow models. Where appropriate, we make adjustments to observed market data to reflect the comparative differences between the market data and the attributes of our equity security, such as differences with public companies and other investment-specific considerations like liquidity, marketability or differences in terms of the instruments.\n",

      "INTERNAL MODEL VALUATIONS Certain Level 3 fair value estimates are based on internal models, such as discounted cash flow or market comparable pricing techniques. Some of the inputs used in these valuations are unobservable. Unobservable inputs are generally derived from or can be correlated to historic performance of similar portfolios or previous market trades in similar instruments where particular unobservable inputs may be implied. We attempt to correlate each unobservable input to historical experience and other third-party data where available. Internal models are subject to review prescribed within our model risk management policies and procedures, which include model validation. Model validation helps ensure our models are appropriate for their intended use and appropriate controls exist to help mitigate risk of invalid valuations. Model validation assesses the adequacy and appropriateness of our models, including reviewing its key components, such as inputs, processing components, logic or theory, output results and supporting model documentation. Validation also includes ensuring significant unobservable model inputs are appropriate given observable market transactions or other market data within the same or similar asset classes. We also have ongoing monitoring procedures in place for our Level 3 assets and liabilities that use internal valuation models. These procedures, which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that models continue to perform as expected, include: •\n",
      "• • ongoing analysis and benchmarking to market transactions and other independent market data (including pricing vendors, if available); back-testing of modeled fair values to actual realized transactions; and review of modeled valuation results against expectations, including review of significant or unusual fluctuations in value.\n",
      "OTHER ASSETS Although other assets are generally recorded at amortized cost, we record nonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect impairments or the impact of certain lease modifications. Other assets subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements include operating lease ROU assets, foreclosed assets and physical commodities. Fair value is generally based upon independent market prices or appraised values less costs to sell, or the use of a discounted cash flow model.\n",
      "Liabilities SHORT-SALE TRADING LIABILITIES Short-sale trading liabilities in our trading business are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and are measured using quoted prices in active markets, where available. When quoted prices for the same instruments are not available or markets are not active, fair values are estimated using recent trades of similar securities.\n",
      "We update model inputs and methodologies periodically to reflect these monitoring procedures. Additionally, existing models are subject to periodic reviews and we perform full model revalidations as necessary.\n",
      "Internal valuation models are subject to ongoing review by the appropriate principal line of business or enterprise function and monitoring oversight by Independent Risk Management. Independent Risk Management, through its Model Risk function, provides independent oversight of model risk management, and its responsibilities include governance, validation, periodic review, and monitoring of model risk across the Company and providing periodic reports to management and the Board’s Risk Committee.\n",

Option model – Option model valuation techniques are generally used for instruments in which the holder has a contingent right or obligation based on the occurrence of a future event, such as the price of a referenced asset going above or below a predetermined strike price. Option models estimate the likelihood of the specified event occurring by incorporating assumptions such as volatility estimates, price of the underlying instrument and expected rate of return. The unobservable inputs presented in the previous tables are those we consider significant to the fair value of the Level 3 asset or liability. We consider unobservable inputs to be significant if by their exclusion the fair value of the Level 3 asset or liability would be impacted by a predetermined percentage change. We also consider qualitative factors, such as nature of the instrument, type of valuation technique used, and the significance of the unobservable inputs relative to other inputs used within the valuation. Following is a description of the significant unobservable inputs provided in the table. • • • • • • Comparability adjustment observed market data, such as a transaction price to reflect dissimilarities in underlying collateral, issuer, rating, or ot her factors used within a market valuation approach, expressed as a percentage of an observed price.

Correlation factor changing in price relative to another based on an established relationship expressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a period over time. Cost to service portfolio of loans, which includes estimates for unreimbursed expenses (including delinquency and foreclosure costs) that may occur as a result of servicing such loan portfolios. Default rate – is an estimate of the likelihood of not collecting contractual amounts owed expressed as a constant default rate (CDR). Discount rate present value of the future expected cash flow to arrive at the fair value of an instrument. The discount rate consists of a benchmark rate component and a risk premium component. The benchmark rate component, for example, OIS, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or U.S. Treasury rates, is generally observable within the market and is necessary to appropriately reflect the time value of money.

      "Involvement with Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability companies or partnerships that are established for a limited purpose. SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization transactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. SPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are generally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE may alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative transactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various forms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer financial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in connection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and sometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets we transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the right to service the transferred assets and repurchase the transferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls below the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the benefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans transferred to a VIE by a third party.\n",
      "In connection with our securitization or other VIE activities, we have various forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which may include: •\n",
      "underwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently making markets in those securities; providing credit enhancement on securities issued by VIEs through the use of letters of credit or financial guarantees; entering into other derivative contracts with VIEs; holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs; acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs; providing administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and providing seller financing to VIEs.\n",

      "MORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE In the normal course of business we sell originated and purchased residential and commercial mortgage loans to government-sponsored entities (GSEs). These loans are generally transferred into securitizations sponsored by the GSEs, which provide certain credit guarantees to investors and servicers. We also transfer mortgage loans into securitization pools pursuant to Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) guidelines which are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Mortgage loans eligible for securitization with the GSEs or GNMA are considered conforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA design the structure of these securitizations, sponsor the involved VIEs, and have power over the activities most significant to the VIE.\n",
      "We account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage loan securitization transactions as sales and do not consolidate the VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In exchange for the transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the VIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment purposes as HTM or AFS securities.

Nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations do not involve a government credit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest holders are subject to credit risk of the underlying assets held by the securitization VIE. We typically originate the transferred loans, account for the transfers as sales and do not consolidate the VIE. We also typically retain the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial interests issued by the VIEs, such as debt securities held for investment purposes. Our servicing role related to nonconforming commercial mortgage loan securitizations is limited to primary or master servicer and the most significant decisions impacting the performance of the VIE are generally made by the special servicer or the controlling class security holder. For our residential nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations accounted for as sales, we either do not hold variable interests that we consider potentially significant or are not the primary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets.\n",

      "WRITTEN OPTIONS We enter into written foreign currency options and over-the-counter written equity put options that are derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee. Written put options give the counterparty the right to sell to us an underlying instrument held by the counterparty at a specified price by a specified date. While these derivative transactions expose us to risk if the option is exercised, we manage this risk by entering into offsetting trades or by taking short positions in the underlying instrument. We offset market risk related to options written to customers with cash securities or other offsetting derivative transactions. Additionally, for certain of these contracts, we require the counterparty to pledge the underlying instrument as collateral for the transaction. Our ultimate obligation under written options is based on future market conditions and is only quantifiable at settlement.

      "LOANS AND LHFS SOLD WITH RECOURSE In certain sales and securitizations of loans, including mortgage loans, we provide recourse to the buyer whereby we are required to indemnify the buyer for any loss on the loan up to par value plus accrued interest. We provide recourse, predominantly to GSEs, on loans sold under various programs and arrangements. Substantially all of these programs and arrangements require that we share in the loans’ credit exposure for their remaining life by providing recourse to the GSE, up to 33.33% of actual losses incurred on a pro-rata basis in the event of borrower default. Under the remaining recourse programs and arrangements, if certain events occur within a specified period of time from transfer date, we have to provide limited recourse to the buyer to indemnify them for losses incurred for the remaining life of the loans. The maximum exposure to loss reported in Table 17.1 represents the outstanding principal balance of the loans sold or securitized that are subject to recourse provisions or the maximum losses per the contractual agreements. However, we believe the likelihood of loss of the entire balance due to these recourse agreements is remote, and amounts paid can be recovered in whole or in part from the sale of collateral. We also provide representation and warranty guarantees on loans sold under the various recourse programs and arrangements. Our loss exposure relative to these guarantees is separately considered and provided for, as necessary, in determination of our liability for loan repurchases due to breaches of representation and warranties.\n",

Our obligations under the guarantees are generally a pro-rata share based on either a fixed amount or a multiple of the guarantee fund we are required to maintain with these organizations. Some membership rules require members to assume a pro-rata share of losses resulting from another member’s default or from non-member default losses after applying the guarantee fund. We have not recorded a liability for these arrangements as of the dates presented in Table 17.1 because we believe the likelihood of loss is remote.\n",

If we are unable to collect the amounts from the merchant, we incur a loss for the refund to the cardholder. We are secondarily obligated to make a refund for transactions involving sponsored merchant processing servicers. We generally have a low likelihood of loss in connection with our merchant processing services because most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are generally refunded when items are returned to the merchant. In addition, we may reduce our risk in connection with these transactions by withholding future payments and requiring cash or other collateral. We estimate our potential maximum exposure to be the total merchant transaction volume processed in the preceding four months, which is generally the lifecycle for a charge-back transaction.

      "GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES In the normal course of business, the Parent may provide counterparties with guarantees related to its subsidiaries’ obligations. These obligations are included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments, and therefore, the Parent has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Parent fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment of principal, interest, and any other amounts that may be due on securities that its 100% owned finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo Finance LLC, may issue. These securities are not guaranteed by any other subsidiary of the Parent. The guaranteed liabilities were $948 million and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These guarantees rank on parity with all of the Parent’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The assets of the Parent consist primarily of equity in its subsidiaries, and the Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. As a result, the Parent’s ability to address claims of holders of these debt securities against the Parent under the guarantee depends on the Parent’s receipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds from its subsidiaries. If any of the Parent’s subsidiaries becomes insolvent, the direct creditors of that subsidiary will have a prior claim on that subsidiary’s assets.

The management reporting process measures the performance of the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed with our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior management. The management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management to assess performance consistently across the operating segments.\n",

      "Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n",
      "We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Wells Fargo & Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statement of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n",
      "We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n",
      "Basis for Opinion\n",
      "These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n",
      "We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n",
      "Critical Audit Matters\n",
      "The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n",
      "Assessment of the allowance for credit losses for loans (ACL)\n",
      "As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s ACL as of December 31, 2022 was $13.6 billion. The ACL includes the measurement of expected credit losses on a collective basis for those loans that share similar risk characteristics utilizing multiple credit loss models. The Company estimated the ACL for commercial loans by applying probability of default and severity of loss estimates to an expected exposure at default. The probability of default and severity of loss estimates are statistically derived through historical observations of default and losses after default for each credit risk rating. The Company estimated the ACL for consumer loans utilizing credit loss models which estimate expected credit losses in the portfolio based on individual risk characteristics of the loans and historical experience of probability of default and severity of loss estimates. The Company’s credit loss models utilize economic variables, including economic assumptions forecast over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The Company forecasts multiple economic scenarios and applies weighting to the scenarios that are used to estimate expected credit losses. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts over the reversion period to the long-term average for the forecasted economic variables based on historical observations over multiple economic cycles. A portion of the ACL is comprised of adjustments for qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models.\n",
      "We identified the assessment of the ACL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the ACL. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the ACL methodology for collectively evaluated loans, including the methods and models used to estimate (1) probability of default and severity of loss estimates, significant economic assumptions, the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the historical observation period, and credit risk ratings for commercial loans, and (2) the adjustments for qualitative factors that may not be adequately captured in the loss models. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of certain credit loss models. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained.\n",

      "Assessment of the residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)\n",
      "As discussed in Notes 1, 6, 15, and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s residential MSR asset as of December 31, 2022 was $9.3 billion on an underlying loan servicing portfolio of $681 billion. The Company recognizes MSRs when it retains servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans it originated or purchases servicing rights from third parties and has elected to carry its residential MSRs at fair value with periodic changes reflected in earnings. The Company uses a valuation model for determining fair value that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income cash flows, which incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income cash flows. These assumptions include estimates of prepayment rates (including estimated borrower defaults), discount rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. The estimated fair value of MSRs is periodically benchmarked to independent appraisals.\n",
      "We identified the assessment of the valuation of residential MSRs as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the MSRs. Specifically, there was a high degree of subjectivity used to evaluate the following assumptions because they are unobservable and the sensitivity of changes to those assumptions had a significant effect on the valuation (1) prepayment rates, (2) discount rates, and (3) cost to service. There was also a high degree of subjectivity and potential for management bias related to updates made to significant assumptions due to changes in market conditions, mortgage interest rates, or servicing standards.\n",

      "Assessment of goodwill impairment\n",
      "As discussed in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance as of December 31, 2022 was $25.2 billion. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired, by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Management estimates the fair value of its reporting units using an income approach and a market approach. The income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis that incorporates assumptions including financial forecasts, a terminal value based on an assumed long-term growth rate, and a discount rate. The financial forecasts include future expectations of economic conditions and balance sheet changes, and considerations related to future business activities. The forecasted cash flows are discounted using a rate derived from a capital asset pricing model which produces an estimated cost of equity to the reporting unit. The market approach utilizes observable market data from comparable publicly traded companies and incorporates assumptions including the selection of comparable companies and a control premium representative of management’s expectation of a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit.\n",
      "We identified the assessment of the goodwill impairment for the Consumer Lending reporting unit, which had $7.1 billion of allocated goodwill as of December 31, 2022, as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of certain assumptions used in the DCF analysis to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit, including (1) the future expectations of balance sheet changes and business activities used in the financial forecast and (2) the discount rate.\n",
      "The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter.

      "We evaluated the reasonableness of the financial forecast assumption for the reporting unit by evaluating historical performance and economic trends. We also evaluated the consistency of the financial forecast assumption by comparing the forecast to other analyses used by the Company and inquiries performed of senior management regarding the strategic plans for the reporting unit, including future expectations of balance sheet changes and business activities. We compared historical financial forecasts to actual results to assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast. In addition, we involved a valuation professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n",

      "WELLS FARGO\n",
      "CEO Letter\n",
      "Dear Shareholders,\n",
      "I’m proud to report that Wells Fargo continued to make progress on our priorities in 2022. Our underlying financial performance is improving, we are moving forward on our risk, control and regulatory agenda, we are focusing on businesses where we can generate appropriate risk-adjusted returns, we continue to strengthen the leadership team, and we are executing on our strategic objectives. While we have made progress, our work is not complete and we remain focused on successful and timely execution of our multi-year journey to complete our risk and control work and to move forward with our businesses.\n",
      "Stronger financial performance\n",
      "Our financial performance benefitted as we continued to drive improved efficiency, and it was positively impacted by both rising rates and a benign credit environment.\n",
      "In 2022, Wells Fargo generated $13.2 billion in net income, or $3.17 per common share. Our results were significantly impacted by $7 billion of operating losses, primarily related to putting historical issues behind us, including litigation, regulatory matters, and customer remediations. However, our performance excluding those items was solid and demonstrates the continued progress we are making to improve returns.\n",
      "Our revenue decreased 6% from the previous year. The higher rate environment and good loan growth drove strong growth in net interest income, which was up 26% from a year ago. However, this growth was more than offset by lower net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking, and investment advisory and other asset-based fees reflecting market conditions, as well as the lost revenue related to businesses we sold in 2021.\n",
      "Expenses increased 6% from a year ago, reflecting higher operating losses primarily related to putting historical matters behind us, as noted above. Excluding operating losses, noninterest expense declined from a year ago, reflecting continued progress on our efficiency initiatives and the impact from business sales. We achieved these efficiency gains while we made continued investments in our risk and control infrastructure and in strategic initiatives across our businesses, and in the face of continued inflationary pressures.\n",
      "Credit quality remained strong, but, as expected, losses started to slowly increase in the second half of the year off their\n",
      "historical lows. Our net charge-off rate declined from 18 basis points in 2021 to 17 basis points in 2022, and our allowance for credit losses declined by $75 million in 2022, as our reserve release in the first quarter was slightly larger than the reserve builds we had in the last three quarters of the year.\n",
      "Loans outstanding increased by 7% from one year ago, with growth in both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Consumer Banking and Lending grew 4%, driven by growth in residential mortgage and credit card, which offset a decline in auto loans. Both Commercial Banking and Corporate and Investment Banking had strong loan growth, with commercial loans up 9% from a year ago, driven by growth across all asset classes. Average deposits in 2022 decreased 1% to $1.42 trillion, as higher market rates spurred customers to look for higher yielding alternatives, and consumers continued to spend savings that built up during the pandemic.\n",
      "Our capital levels remained well above our required regulatory minimums plus buffers. We increased our quarterly common stock dividend in the first quarter of 2022 from $0.20 per share to $0.25 per share and then to $0.30 in the third quarter of 2022. While we did not repurchase any common stock in the last three quarters of 2022, we have repurchased shares in the first quarter of 2023.\n",
      "Our return on equity was 7.5% and our return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) was 9.0%1. Both of these ratios were impacted by the operating losses I highlighted earlier.\n",
      "In my shareholder letter over the past two years, I have discussed our path to higher returns. Since 2020, we have executed on a number of important items to improve our returns, including returning $16 billion to shareholders through net common stock repurchases, increasing our common stock dividend from $0.10 per share to $0.30 per share, and delivering approximately $7.5 billion of gross expense saves. Based on these actions and others that are in flight, we believe we have a clear line of sight to a sustainable ROTCE of approximately 15% in the medium term. In order to achieve that, we need to continue to optimize our capital, including returning capital to shareholders and redeploying capital to higher returning businesses; execute on efficiency initiatives; and benefit from the investments we are making in our businesses.\n",
      "1 Return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the “Financial Review – Capital Management – Tangible Common Equity” section in this Report.\n",
      "2022 Annual Report\n",
      "We are actively watching the economy\n",
      "Consumers\n",
      "After a period of strong economic growth and low unemployment, the Federal Reserve has been increasing interest rates aggressively with a goal of combatting high inflation. Increasing interest rates and a slowing economy have caused headwinds for some of our customers, but our customers have largely remained resilient over the past year, with deposit balances, consumer spending and credit quality still stronger than pre-pandemic levels.\n",
      "Consumer credit card spend continued to be strong in 2022, with spending up 25% compared with 2021, which reflects the benefit of new Wells Fargo product launches. Almost all spending categories had double-digit spend growth year over year. Consumer debit card spend slowed to 3% growth in 2022 compared to 2021. Growth was driven by ticket size since transaction volume was flat year-over-year, and discretionary spend outpaced non-discretionary spend.\n",
      "At the same time, we are carefully watching the impact of higher rates and we expect to see deposit balances continue to decrease and credit quality to continue to weaken. For certain cohorts of customers, average deposit balances are below pre-pandemic levels, and we are closely monitoring activity for signs of potential stress. For our borrowers, we are working to limit the risk – both to them and to us – of overextension. We have taken selective actions across our consumer lending businesses to mitigate risks associated with inflation and increased debt leverage. In our auto business, we have adjusted policies to address risk associated with collateral value declines and inflationary pressures on consumers’ ability to pay. In home lending, we have tightened loan-to-value policies nationally and even more so in local markets that have elevated home value risk. Additionally, in our card business, we have tightened our lending policy to focus on applicants who may be exhibiting debt-seeking behavior.\n",
      "Businesses\n",
      "Commercial loans grew 9% in 2022, with most of the growth in the first half of the year. Higher inventory levels contributed to increased working capital needs, which drove higher utilization rates. However, utilization rates stabilized in the second half of the year, and current data is not pointing to additional inventory builds, which indicates most businesses are carefully managing inventory levels amid slowing demand.\n",
      "We continue to closely monitor the most pandemic-impacted sectors and inflation-sensitive industries in our commercial portfolio. This includes:\n",
      "Updating underwriting guidelines to include interest-rate\n",
      "sensitivity to leveraged loans\n",
      "ii\n",
      "Analyzing supply chain issues, inflationary pressures, and the\n",
      "impact of a potential recession\n",
      "The Commercial Real Estate office market is showing signs of weakness due to lower demand, driving higher vacancy rates and deteriorating operating performance. Challenging economic and capital market conditions are also buffeting the office market, and while we haven’t seen this translate to significant loss content yet, we do expect to see stress over time and are proactively working with borrowers to manage our exposure. Specifically, we have issued underwriting guidance for navigating current conditions, including limited tolerance for new credit policy exceptions, increasing minimum debt yield thresholds, and stress testing and expansion of the watchlist process, including additional emphasis on the office market.\n",
      "Looking ahead to the remainder of 2023, we are prepared for a range of scenarios. As a large lender to both consumers and businesses in the United States, we have significant credit exposure across our businesses, and as the Federal Reserve continues to take action to reduce inflation, we will continue to monitor both the markets and our own customer data and will react accordingly. If our view of economic stress deteriorates from our view at the end of 2022, we will likely add to credit loss reserves during 2023.\n",
      "Moving forward on our risk, control, and regulatory agenda We continue to move forward with the foundational work of building out a risk and control framework appropriate for our company. This multi-year journey continues to be about setting clear priorities, cultural change, and operational execution. I have been clear and consistently reinforce that this foundational work is our top priority. This should always be the case for a bank such as ours, but this has not always been the case, so reinforcement is necessary. We remain confident in our ability to complete this work and build appropriate risk, control, and operational excellence into our culture.\n",
      "The Acting Comptroller of the Currency gave an important speech in January addressing the potential difficulties of managing a large bank. Given that the OCC is a key supervisor of ours, we take the speech seriously and are focused on its key messages.\n",
      "The speech focused on the view that there are limits to an organization’s manageability based on size and, if so, that the most efficient and effective way to fix this is to compel its simplification. I am not in a position to agree or disagree with this premise, but I am in a position to have the strong point of view that Wells Fargo is not too big or complex to manage. Our shortcomings are not structural, but they are the result of historically ineffective management and the lack of proper prioritization of building out an appropriate risk and control environment that will ultimately take multiple years to correct.\n",
      "We are large but are far less complex than many with whom we compete. In fact, we have more similarities with regional banks than other global systemically important banks (GSIBs), and strong and effective risk management processes should scale to a company of our size. In addition, we have acted and will continue to act on our own to simplify our company and reduce operational complexity and risk, as I detail in the section later in this letter entitled “Executing on Strategic Objectives.”\n",
      "Operating at a broad scale but with less complexity than peers\n",
      "1. We are primarily a US domestic bank and we do not have the many complexities that running large-scale international businesses bring. Our legal entity structure, extent of international regulatory oversight and physical footprint are far simpler than many of our competitors. Approximately 90% of our revenues come from U.S. clients or activities of non-U.S. clients in the U.S. Our businesses outside the U.S. primarily support our U.S. customer base. We are very happy with our existing footprint and are not looking beyond for growth opportunities. 2. Our products are not complex compared with those offered by other banks and are similar to those offered by smaller institutions. We predominantly provide the same products and services as regional and smaller, more local banks. We take deposits, provide financing, move money, and provide financial advice for our customers. Our trading activities and the size of our market risk are relatively small compared to other large GSIBs. 3. Scale in each of our businesses should not make us more complex. Our distribution methods are similar to smaller institutions. We manage a branch network, have relationship managers across our markets, market through the internet, traditional advertising, direct mail, and word of mouth, and we rely on our local reputation. The controls necessary to manage a network of 4,000+ branches are similar to those necessary to manage a smaller branch network. The same is true for managing relationship managers, marketing, and protecting our reputation. Senior management should be involved at a detailed level, but all institutions should have and rely on defined control frameworks in place that are effective at risk management, regardless of individuals in a seat. These frameworks can effectively scale to a bank of our size. 4. Our customers benefit from our size and reach. Wells Fargo has nearly 4,600 retail bank branches, with a presence in 25 of the largest 30 markets in the U.S. A Wells Fargo branch or ATM is within 2 miles of over half of U.S. Census households and small businesses in our footprint. The range of banking services we provide helps us build full relationships with individuals and companies, allowing us to see a full picture of their personal, family, and/or business financial needs, and to meet these needs. We have the ability to invest in technology to make it faster, safer, and\n",
      "more transparent for our customers to handle their banking needs. In addition, our resources allow us to innovate quickly, developing new products, services, and digitized experiences to meet constantly changing consumer and business expectations. These capabilities, along with our size and reach, are of tangible benefit to consumers across the country, whether they live in large cities or more rural areas, and also to the U.S. economy as a whole.\n",
      "Managing the company with significantly heightened discipline\n",
      "We agree that there are also traits that management should avoid as they grow. These signs are familiar to us, as we identified them as historical behaviors at Wells Fargo when I arrived. We viewed them then – as we do now – as unacceptable. Our approach today is dramatically different than it was at Wells Fargo in the past and we will continue to work so it becomes part of our culture at all levels in the organization.\n",
      "1. Don’t hide behind materiality – As a large institution we know we cannot let our size hide potential issues. We must think about raw numbers, not just percentages which are indexed to a large customer base, asset base, or capital base. We have built functions and processes to review customer complaints, employee allegations, and issues raised from outside the company, and aim to use them to identify issues and themes so we can address them and make changes as required. 2. Don’t assume incidents are isolated – One of the advantages large institutions have is the amount of data and information we see and have, but we must use it expeditiously. Individual incidents provide data points which can help us learn and react, and we should treat each as such. We strive to make data-driven decisions and to explore whether incidents that can appear isolated can in fact have broader application elsewhere in the company. 3. Identify weaknesses ourselves and address them quickly – The Acting Comptroller stated that “the business of banking is operationally intensive. Even at banks with strong teams and robust risk management systems and controls, mistakes and problems can arise. Well-managed banks identify such problems early and often, address them quickly, and take steps to prevent their recurrence.” We agree completely. Many of the historical issues we continue to work through were identified by regulators, not by us. We are changing this, emphasizing our responsibility to self-identify more issues and address them with a heightened sense of urgency. As we implement our risk and control framework, we will likely identify more issues and move with haste to implement compensating and ultimately permanent controls. Our risk and control framework is not a project, but an ongoing set of actions, and it will be part of our culture. 4. Hubris, contempt, and indifference are unacceptable and dangerous traits – We cannot believe that we know better\n",
      "2022 Annual Report\n",
      "iii\n",
      "than others and need to react with seriousness and urgency when issues are raised – whether from employees, customers, regulators, or others outside the company. Every issue raised has the opportunity to be a learning moment and we should also proactively look at our competitors to learn as well. Integration of mergers is more than a short-term technology conversion – While we have not had a merger- related systems integration in my time at Wells Fargo, we agree that “simply stitch[ing]…systems together” can cause a proliferation of issues. It is critical to merge and simplify platforms, whether merger-related or as part of a customer service strategy, as the reduced complexity in the number of platforms should make it easier to properly serve customers. For example, asking customer-service representatives to learn multiple systems to provide the same information creates more operational risk and the possibility of a poor customer experience. But these platform mergers should be the beginning of integration, not the end. This is true looking both from our perspective and the customer perspective. Customers think of us as one company, not as separate relationships with individual lines of business. They want to see their information seamlessly and be able to transact with us easily across all of their products. Unless we integrate our platforms, we will either not appear as one company to the customer, or we will create workarounds to try and accomplish this, which creates unneeded operational risk. A major competitive advantage of Wells Fargo is serving our customers across a broad range of products, but we can only do so effectively with common platforms. The same is true of data platforms. Pulling customer data from multiple platforms is operationally complex and expensive. Common data platforms across our company are critical. We rely on this for financial reporting, regulatory reporting, risk reporting, and the ability to assess a customer relationship holistically. And finally, it is a mistake to lose sight of aged platforms, to not invest in improving them and to not move to new ones. New software and hardware solutions make it easier to reduce complexity and properly serve customers, and when these solutions are part of a program with a clear target state, they should significantly reduce operational complexity. Recognizing this, Wells Fargo is implementing a modern technology stack that is cloud-native and therefore more elastic and resilient. We are applying this stack for the various product domains that we are modernizing across our businesses. Examples include a more modern digital desktop for our financial advisors in Wealth and Investment Management, our value-at-risk models in Corporate and Investment Banking, and our payment platforms across businesses. These modernization initiatives are guided top-down by a product and platform architecture that sets\n",
      "5.\n",
      "iv\n",
      "clear boundaries and expectations for teams. In addition to this, the hosting of our platforms is more and more migrating to a combination of private and public cloud, powered by our partnerships with Google and Microsoft. This also is leading to faster innovation by plugging in innovative services provided by these cloud providers into our platforms. In parallel to these modernization efforts, we are also enhancing the way we deliver software and the developer experience. We are implementing new cloud-native tool- chains that allow our developers to have the experience that they deserve: on-demand, instant, elastic and with embedded automated controls.\n",
      "Further taking stock of where we stand – why haven’t we completed our risk and regulatory work\n",
      "I am frequently asked why our risk and regulatory work is not complete though we have been publicly reprimanded, have a growth constraint, and I have been leading the company for over 3 years. I wish my job was merely to complete work that was well underway, but unfortunately this was not the case. Simply said, the work to build the appropriate risk and control infrastructure and close consent orders takes years when managed effectively, and we were not as far along as I had expected when I arrived. Much work was needed to build what is necessary to properly accomplish the work.\n",
      "When I arrived, we did not have the culture, effective processes, or appropriate management oversight in place to remediate weaknesses on a timely basis. Today, we approach these issues differently. This management team (the broad team – not just me) has the skills and experience and is now responsible for closing our consent orders. We have changed and implemented much to put ourselves in a position to have the confidence that we can accomplish this. The specifics of our regulatory remediation plans are confidential, and while we are not where we need to be, I believe that our position is significantly improved and that we will reach our goals. We are committed to making all necessary resources available to meet our obligations.\n",
      "I have said we are a different company today, and in this sub-section, I provide some examples.\n",
      "1. When I arrived at the company in 2019, we had 12 open, public enforcement actions. Given this and the other control issues we needed to assess, it took many months to understand the depth and breadth of the weaknesses and what was required to complete the work. 2. We then went about recruiting a mostly new management team with the experience and skills that we did not sufficiently have at the company. A large portion of the Operating Committee was recruited during 2020 and they then needed to do their own assessments and develop plans. They then needed several years to build out their teams.\n",
      "3. For each consent order Matters Requiring Attention (MRAs), and other control gaps identified, we needed to build detailed plans that satisfied both us and our regulators. Our plans are now detailed and have hundreds of deliverables with designated delivery dates. Many of our consent orders have work that relies on work from another order, so any slippage on one plan can impact another. Our ability to assess all of this accurately for work to be done over multiple years has not been perfect, and we have missed some deliverables, but we have learned, adjusted, and continue to move forward. 4. We needed to build processes to manage these across the company. Building reporting and setting up management review structures for these activities has been critical to moving the work forward. Most of these did not exist or were ineffective, and we now believe we have much more effective reporting and processes in place to provide appropriate oversight and allow us to identify issues early so we can course-correct. 5. We did not have the resources necessary to accomplish this work when I arrived. We have added close to 10,000 people across numerous risk- and control-related groups and have spent approximately $2 billion more in 2022 than in 2018 in these areas. We are committed to make the investments needed to complete the work. 6. And we had to build the management disciplines and culture to govern and execute such a large body of work. Our Operating Committee reviews risk and regulatory progress and escalations on a weekly basis. We provide detailed reporting to the full board and appropriate committees so they can provide oversight. These reviews are systematic and detailed, and they are helping us provide the appropriate oversight and involvement to accomplish the work.\n",
      "I should add that we had to do all of this during the very worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. While we were not alone in dealing with the complexities of work from home, social distancing and meeting the needs of customers during a pandemic, we were alone in what we had to build, and doing so in a remote working environment increased the difficulty level significantly.\n",
      "Some have suggested that banks view enforcement actions and fines as a cost of doing business, but I can tell you that today, nothing is further from the truth at Wells Fargo. We view any such action by our regulators as something that requires immediate management attention. We aim both to avoid the necessity of such action by doing the work ourselves and, when regulators do take enforcement action against us, we follow a disciplined process to work towards closure, again with all necessary resources available for the effort.\n",
      "The negative impact on our reputation of having not fulfilled our obligations is clear. Simply put, failure to satisfy our regulatory requirements carries significant consequences for our company. On the other hand, fulfilling our obligations and building an\n",
      "appropriate risk and control framework will allow us to build a strong reputation amongst a broad set of stakeholders. So why do we have so many consent orders that have been open for extended periods? Again, our historical practices were inadequate, and it has taken time to build what is necessary to change our historical inadequacies.\n",
      "So as I look at our situation today, the failure of Wells Fargo to complete its work appropriately has resulted in multiple consent orders, fines, and an asset cap. But I can say confidently that we have taken significant actions including focusing and simplifying the company, refreshing the board, replacing most of the senior management team, and are now moving forward to correct past deficiencies. We have the willingness and the ability to complete the work.\n",
      "And to be clear, we are committed to prioritizing this work above all else by devoting all necessary resources to the effort. Our planning is designed to ensure other activities do not interfere with this top priority. If we have a conflict, our risk and control work comes first.\n",
      "I have said our progress will likely not be a straight line. We continue to resolve issues that were found years ago or are the result of the inadequate control environment that existed when we arrived at the company. This means that resolution of outstanding issues such as litigation, customer remediations or regulatory investigations have and could continue to have financial impacts. Additionally, until our work is complete, we will likely find new issues that need to be remediated, and these may result in additional regulatory actions.\n",
      "Finally, as we continue to execute on our detailed plans, given the scope and complexity of our work, we may miss some interim milestones. We recognize the importance of meeting milestones that we ourselves set, but perfection is unlikely. When we discover an issue, we act quickly to course-correct and do what we can to get back on schedule. This is frustrating for us and others outside the company but is not indicative of our willingness or ability to complete our work. Rather, it is an obstacle that presents itself in nearly any large-scale, multi-year transformation.\n",
      "When Wells Fargo faces criticism about where we stand, I understand the sentiment. I hope this section has provided detailed context and is helpful in providing an understanding of what we are doing to close our gaps. This team is taking decisive action to move our company past these issues.\n",
      "Leadership Team Key to transforming the company, changing our culture, and realizing the full strength of our franchise is having the best management team in place. Since I joined the company in 2019, 12 of our 17 Operating Committee members are new to Wells Fargo and 15 are new to their roles. In 2022, we put in place a new Chief Auditor, a new Chief Risk Officer, a new head of Consumer Lending, and a new head of Diverse Segments, Representation and Inclusion.\n",
      "2022 Annual Report\n",
      "We continue to refresh our management ranks more broadly. Over 80% of our senior executive leaders – a group of approximately 150 people, most of whom report to Operating Committee members – are new to their roles since 2019, and nearly 60% are new to the company over the same time period. Over 30% of the individuals in this senior executive cohort began in new roles in 2022 or 2023. New leaders who have joined over the past several years bring important experience that is necessary for our journey.\n",
      "Executing on Strategic Objectives\n",
      "Simplifying our business\n",
      "We continue to review the strategic positioning of the company and are focusing our efforts on building products and services that are core to serving our clients. This focus has led us to decisions to sell, downsize, or curtail multiple businesses. These decisions simplify the company, reduce operational complexity and risk, and allow us to focus on both our core risk and control buildout and ways to serve our customers in our core franchises. There are several examples since I joined the company in 2019.\n",
      "In January 2023, we announced plans to simplify our Home Lending business and will primarily serve bank and wealth management customers as well as borrowers in minority communities. As part of this shift, we announced our plans to exit the Correspondent business, reduce the size of our Servicing portfolio, and optimize our Retail team so it aligns with our narrower customer focus. These actions will allow us to reduce risk in the Home Lending business while continuing making homeownership possible to thousands of Americans. Over the past year, we have taken several additional steps to simplify the way we operate. For instance, we have: • Implemented a cloud-native operating model which will enable us to reduce reliance on older, less stable platforms and allows us to innovate faster • Centrally organized our Control Management teams, to enable better coordination across our businesses • Streamlined our divisional leadership in Wells Fargo Advisors, moving from eight regional divisions to four • Combined Treasury Services platforms across Commercial Banking and Corporate and Investment Banking Looking further back to 2021, 2020, and 2019, we have: • Sold Wells Fargo Asset Management • Sold our Corporate Trust Services business • Sold our student lending portfolio and stopped the origination of new student loans • Exited our international wealth management segment • Sold our Canadian direct equipment finance business\n",
      "vi\n",
      "Stopped offering new home equity lines and loans\n",
      "• Exited the direct Auto business • Stopped originating personal lines of credit • Sold our Institutional Retirement and Trust business • In addition, over the past several years, we have closed over a dozen representative offices globally to better focus our international business, including offices in Asia, Europe, South America, the Middle East, and elsewhere.\n",
      "• In addition, over the past several years, we have closed over a dozen representative offices globally to better focus our international business, including offices in Asia, Europe, South America, the Middle East, and elsewhere. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate our businesses with an eye toward reducing complexity, increasing risk-adjusted returns, and focusing our resources on the most important products and services our customers require. Market dynamics change, the competitive environment changes, regulatory expectations evolve and we must adjust our business accordingly.\n",
      "Focusing on customer needs and expectations\n",
      "Each of our businesses is working to transform how we serve our customers by offering focused, innovative products and solutions. Many of the initiatives underway reduce risk in the company and we evaluate new initiatives to consider the potential impact on our control environment. Some examples are below.\n",
      "Our Consumer Businesses: Consumer and Small Business Banking, Consumer Lending, and Wealth and Investment Management\n",
      "• We rolled out our new consumer mobile app with a simpler, more intuitive user experience which has improved customer satisfaction. We also completed the development of Fargo, our new AI-powered virtual assistant, which provides a more personalized, convenient, and simple consumer banking experience. Fargo is currently live for eligible employees and is set to begin rolling out to customers during the first half of this year. Providing such digitized services directly to our customers reduces operational complexity in our service centers and increases customer satisfaction. • We continued to improve our credit card offerings including launching two new cards – Wells Fargo Autograph and BILT. While we describe these as new products, these are actually updated products in a business we have been in for many years. • We launched Wells Fargo Premier, our new offering dedicated to the financial needs of affluent clients by bringing together our branch-based and wealth-based businesses to provide a more comprehensive, relevant, and integrated offering for our clients. • We also relaunched Intuitive Investor in our Wealth and Investment Management segment, making it easier for customers to invest with a streamlined account opening process and a lower minimum investment.\n",
      "Our Wholesale Businesses: Commercial Banking and Corporate and Investment Banking\n",
      "• We have made several hires in Corporate and Investment Banking that have received some press. These hires are in industries we currently serve and products we currently offer, but the individuals bring new expertise to Wells Fargo. • We continued to enhance the partnership within our commercial businesses to bring Corporate and Investment Banking products such as foreign exchange and M&A advisory services to our middle-market corporate clients. • In December we announced Vantage, an enhanced digital experience for our commercial and corporate clients. Vantage uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide a tailored and intuitive platform based on our clients’ specific needs. • Over the past year our industry-leading API platform team continued the development of payment APIs for commercial and corporate clients, invested in solutions to support our financial institution clients, ramped-up and grew product offerings in consumer lending, and began developing commercial lending solutions.\n",
      "Evolving our approach to technology\n",
      "Technology is helping us better serve our consumer and corporate clients. Our technology talent is modernizing platforms for our customers, clients and colleagues. Specific areas of focus are:\n",
      "• A cross-product pricing platform\n",
      "• Digitization of our lending origination platforms across Small Business, Commercial and Corporate Banking • Continued modernization of our Treasury Services and Payments platforms • Strengthening our technological capabilities in fraud prevention • Modernizing key corporate risk platforms • Refreshing our Auto loans platform\n",
      "These enhanced digital capabilities are just the start of the initiatives we have planned as part of our multi-year digital transformation.\n",
      "Seeing early returns from this work\n",
      "Our work to build better, more customer-focused products and a more technology-enabled company is generating measurable returns. For instance:\n",
      "• In Consumer and Small Business Banking, mobile active customers grew 4% from a year ago. • The new credit cards I mentioned above helped drive a 31% increase in new credit card accounts in 2022, and we’ve continued to maintain strong credit profiles. The average\n",
      "FICO score of our new accounts in 2022 was 773, compared to 761 for the 2019 vintage. • In Wealth and Investment Management, total active Intuitive Investor accounts increased 56% from a year ago. • Our U.S. investment banking market share was 3.2% in 2022, up 61 basis points versus 2021. We had the #7 ranking in this year’s U.S. investment banking league tables, up two spots from 2021. • As a company, we deliver many solutions nowadays in sprints, reducing our through-put time by as much as 60% compared to 2020.\n",
      "ESG, communities and customer centricity As I look back at 2022, I’m enthusiastic about the progress we’ve made in serving our communities and our customers, and I feel even better about the opportunities ahead.\n",
      "Let me start with the changes we made during the year to help millions of customers avoid overdraft fees and meet short-term cash needs. These efforts included:\n",
      "The elimination of non-sufficient funds fees and transfer fees\n",
      "for customers enrolled in Overdraft Protection. • Early Pay Day, making eligible direct deposits available up to two days early. • Extra Day Grace, giving eligible customers an extra business day to make deposits to avoid overdraft fees. • And in the fourth quarter we launched Flex Loan, a new digital-only, small-dollar loan that provides eligible customers convenient and affordable access to funds. Teams from across the company came together to roll out this new product in just a few months. Though it’s still early, customer response is exceeding our expectations.\n",
      "The above actions build on services we’ve introduced over the past several years, including Clear Access Banking, a consumer banking account with no overdraft fees. We now have over 1.7 million of those accounts, up 48% from a year ago.\n",
      "Beyond our customers, we have an important responsibility to strengthen the communities we serve. We continued that work in 2022. This was true on several fronts.\n",
      "Supporting homeownership\n",
      "• We launched a Special Purpose Credit Program in 2022, committing $150 million to advance racial equity in homeownership, with an additional $100 million investment towards this racial equity effort announced in 2023. • We established Wealth Opportunities Restored through Homeownership, or WORTH, a $60 million national effort to address systematic barriers to homeownership for people of color. Nationally, WORTH aims to help create 40,000 new homeowners of color in eight markets by the end of 2025\n",
      "2022 Annual Report\n",
      "vii\n",
      "• We announced an expansion of our Dream.Plan.Home closing cost credit, which provides borrowers with an income at or below 80% of the area median income where the property is located up to $5,000 to use toward closing costs. The credit is available in 16 states and in Washington, DC. • We announced Growing Diverse Housing Developers, a $40 million grant initiative focused on expanding the growth and success of real estate developers of color, including Black- and Latino-owned firms.\n",
      "Banking inclusion\n",
      "• As part of our Banking Inclusion Initiative, we launched our first Community Connections Branch outside Atlanta, with more to come. These branches offer spaces for financial health seminars and individual consultations. • Also as part of our Banking Inclusion Initiative, we announced plans with Operation HOPE to introduce HOPE Inside centers in 20 markets. HOPE Inside Centers feature financial coaches who will help empower community members to achieve their financial goals through financial education and free one-on-one coaching. To date, we’ve launched these centers in the Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, Oakland and Phoenix metro regions. • Since its launch in 2022, our Small Business Resource Navigator has connected nearly 1,300 small businesses to potential credit opportunities and technical assistance services provided by CDFIs.\n",
      "Climate initiatives\n",
      "• We announced interim greenhouse gas reduction targets for the Oil & Gas and Power sectors. • We issued our second Inclusive Communities and Climate Bond, a $2 billion bond that will finance projects and programs supporting housing affordability, economic opportunity, renewable energy and clean transportation.\n",
      "In addition, we have made significant progress on our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives. These are detailed in our first Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion annual report, which we published last summer. We continue to push forward on our commitment to integrating DE&I across the company, and, as part of this commitment, we have commissioned an external, third-party Racial Equity Assessment. We plan to publish the results of the assessment by the end of this year.\n",
      "I’m proud of all this work. We are balanced in our approach to environmental, social and governance issues, and, as I wrote a year ago, we believe that for us to be successful as a company, we must consider a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions, beyond shareholders. This is not in lieu of shareholders – in fact we believe it will enhance our returns to shareholders over time. Our history has shown this to be true. Consumers and businesses want to do business with a company that has a strong reputation. A strong reputation is achieved not\n",
      "viii\n",
      "just from strong financial performance, but from actively supporting employees, customers, and communities – especially those most in need.\n",
      "As we look forward I remain confident in our company. The franchise we have is enviable and will become increasingly more so as we transform the company. We have done much and we must finish the risk and control work I’ve described in a timeframe and with the quality to satisfy our regulators to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us, so this will remain our top priority.\n",
      "We will do this while we navigate what will likely be a tricky economic environment. 2022 was a turning point in the cycle and the impact of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases have not been fully seen in the economy yet. Though we are starting to see the impact on consumer spend, credit, housing, and demands for goods and services, it is still early. Thus far, the impact to consumers and businesses has been manageable.\n",
      "Though there will certainly be some industries and segments of consumers that are more impacted than others, the rate of impact we see in our customer base is not materially accelerating. This plus the strength with which consumers and businesses went into this slowing economy is a helpful set of facts as we look forward.\n",
      "While we are not predicting a severe downturn, we must be prepared for one and we are a stronger company today than 1 and 2 years ago. We have actively managed our capital position and focused on efficiency. Our margins are wider, our returns are higher, we are better managed, and our capital position is strong. While we will be impacted by a downturn in the economic cycle, we feel prepared for a downside scenario if we see broader deterioration than we currently see or predict.\n",
      "We still have clear opportunities to improve our performance as we make progress on our efficiency initiatives. We will invest as necessary in our risk and control infrastructure, we will modernize our existing platforms, and we will continue to make the investments necessary serve our customers through service, technology and product enhancements.\n",
      "I want to conclude by thanking our employees across the company who are working hard each day to continue to make progress on our transformation. The pressure they feel to accomplish our work is immense and the dedication that I see is unmatched. I’m thankful for all that they do and remain committed to leading us towards the goal of being the most respected financial institution in the country.\n",
      "I’m excited about all that we will accomplish in the year ahead.\n",

The Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other regulatory actions, which may require the Company, among other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, operations, products and services, and risk management practices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to take multiple years, and we are likely to experience issues or delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. Issues o r delays with one regulatory action could affect our progress on others, and failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulator y action on a timely basis could result in additional penalties, business restrictions, enforcement actions, and other negative consequences, which could be significant.

As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company’s compliance and operational risk management program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the Company works to address the consent order provisions. The consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial third-party review of the enhancements and improvements\n",

Until this third-party review is complete and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined under the consent order will be limited to the level as of December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of temporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements.\n",
      "Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program and past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management of remediation activities conducted by the Company. The Company continues to work to address the provisions of the consent orders. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home Lending business.

The required actions related to many of these matters were already substantially complete at the time we entered into the consent order, and the consent order lays out a path to termination after the Company completes the remainder of the required actions.\n",
      "Retail Sales Practices Matters In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers received products and services they did not request. As a result, it remains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive action plan that includes making things right for our customers, employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better Company for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB consent order regarding retail sales practices expired.\n",

      "Recent Developments LIBOR Transition The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely referenced benchmark rate that seeks to estimate the cost at which banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other banks. On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced that certain settings of LIBOR would no longer be published on a representative basis after December 31, 2021, and the most commonly used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings would no longer be published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. Central banks in various jurisdictions convened committees to identify replacement rates to facilitate the transition away from LIBOR. The committee convened by the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the replacement rate for USD LIBOR. In first quarter 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the LIBOR Act) was enacted into U.S. federal law to provide a statutory framework to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on SOFR in U.S. law contracts that do not have fallback provisions or that have fallback provisions resulting in a replacement rate based on LIBOR. The FRB adopted a final rule implementing the LIBOR Act on December 16, 2022, which will become effective on February 27, 2023. We expect that the LIBOR Act will transition certain of our legacy USD LIBOR contracts that do not have appropriate fallback provisions to the applicable SOFR-based replacement rates specified in the FRB’s final rule.\n",
      "We no longer offer new contracts referencing LIBOR, subject to limited exceptions based on regulatory guidance. During 2022, we executed certain LIBOR transition activities to enhance our operational readiness such as the development of new alternative reference rate products, model and system updates, and employee training.\n",
      "For certain contracts, including commercial credit facilities and related derivatives, we continue to proactively engage with our clients and contract parties to replace LIBOR with SOFR- based rates or other alternative reference rates in advance of the June 30, 2023 cessation date.\n",
      "consumer loans, commercial credit facilities, debt securities, derivatives, and long-term debt indexed to USD LIBOR to transition to SOFR-based or other alternative reference rates in accordance with existing fallback provisions or the LIBOR Act.\n",
      "We have accrued for the probable and estimable costs related to our customer remediation activities, which amounts may change based on additional facts and information, as well as ongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. As our ongoing reviews continue and as we continue to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure, we have identified and may in the future identify additional items or areas of potential concern. To the extent issues are identified, we will continue to assess any customer harm and provide remediation as appropriate. We have previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of these activities.\n",

Commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were $79 million, or 1 basis point of average commercial loans, in 2022, compared with net loan charge-offs of $295 million, or 6 basis points, in 2021, driven by lower losses in our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate mortgage portfolios. Consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were $1.5 billion, or 39 basis points of average consumer loans, in 2022, compared with net loan charge-offs of $1.3 billion, or 33 basis points, in 2021, predominantly due to higher losses in our auto portfolio.

The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it enables management, investors, and others to assess the Company’s use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures, see the “Capital Management – Tangible Common Equity” section in this Report. The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income).

All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in Corporate. For additional information, see segments by type of product and customer segment, and their results are based on our management reporting process. The management reporting process measures the performance of the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed with our Chief Executive management. The management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenu and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management to assess performance consistently across the operating segments.\n",
      "Funds Transfer Pricing Corporate treasury manages a funds transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or credits is recognized in corporate treasury.\n",

Adjustments are included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated financial results.\n",
      "Allocated Capital Reportable operating segments are allocated capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are periodically assessed and revised. Management believes that return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it enables management, investors, and others to assess a reportable operating segment’s use of capital.\n",

Our off-balance sheet arrangements include unfunded credit commitments, transactions with unconsolidated entities, guarantees, commitments to purchase debt and equity securities, derivatives, and other commitments. These transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify our funding sources.\n",
      "Guarantees and Other Arrangements Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, written options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar arrangements. For additional information, see Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report.\n",
      "Unfunded Credit Commitments Unfunded credit commitments are legally binding agreements to lend to customers with terms covering usage of funds, contractual interest rates, expiration dates, and any required collateral. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will generally be lower than the contractual amount because these commitments may expire without being used or may be cancelled at the customer’s request. Our credit risk monitoring activities include managing the amount of commitments, both to individual customers and in total, and the size and maturity structure of these commitments.

      "Risk is Part of our Business Model. Risk is the possibility of an event occurring that could adversely affect the Company’s ability to achieve its strategic or business objectives. The Company routinely takes risks to achieve its business goals and to serve its customers. These risks include financial risks, such as interest rate, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and non-financial risks, such as operational risk, which includes compliance and model risks, and strategic and reputation risks.\n",
      "Risk Profile. The Company’s risk profile is an assessment of the aggregate risks associated with the Company’s exposures and business activities after taking into consideration risk management effectiveness. The Company monitors its risk profile, and the Board reviews risk profile reports and analysis.\n",
      "Risk Capacity. Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk that the Company could assume given its current level of resources before triggering regulatory and other constraints on its capital and liquidity needs.\n",
      "Risk Appetite. Risk appetite is the amount of risk, within its risk capacity, the Company is comfortable taking given its current level of resources. Risk appetite is articulated in our Statement of Risk Appetite, which establishes acceptable risks and at what level and includes risk appetite principles.

The Company continuously monitors its risk appetite, and the Board reviews reports which include risk appetite information and analysis.\n",
      "Risk is Managed by Everyone. Every employee, in the course of their daily activities, creates risk and is responsible for managing risk. Every employee has a role to play in risk management, including establishing and maintaining the Company’s control environment. Every employee must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and Company policies.\n",
      "Risk and Culture. Senior management sets the tone at the top by supporting a strong culture, defined by the Company’s expectations, that guides how employees conduct themselves and make decisions. The Board oversees senior management in establishing and maintaining this culture and effectively managing risk. Senior management expects employees to speak up when they see something that could cause harm to the Company’s customers, communities, employees, shareholders, or reputation. Because risk management is everyone’s responsibility, all employees are empowered to and expected to challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their concerns when they have not been addressed. The Company’s performance management and incentive compensation programs are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk and reward under core principles that employees are expected to know and practice. The Board, through its Human Resources Committee, plays an important role in overseeing and providing credible challenge to the Company’s performance management and incentive compensation programs. Effective risk management is a central component of employee performance evaluations.\n",

It is approved by the Board’s Risk Committee and reviewed and updated annually. Many other documents and policies flow from its core principles.\n",
      "Risk and Strategy. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) drives the Company’s strategic planning process, which identifies the Company’s most significant opportunities and challenges, develops options to address them, and evaluates the risks and trade-offs of each. The Company’s risk profile, risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness are considered in the strategic planning process, which is linked with the Company’s capital planning process. The Company’s Independent Risk Management (IRM) organization participates in strategic planning, providing challenge to and independent assessment of the risks associated with strategic initiatives. IRM also independently assesses and challenges the impact of the strategic plan on risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness at the principal lines of business, enterprise functions, and aggregate Company level. After review, the strategic plan is presented to the Board each year with IRM’s evaluation.\n",

The Company is committed to helping mitigate the impacts of climate change related to its activities and to partner with key stakeholders, including communities and customers, to do the same. The Company expects that climate change will increasingly impact the risk types it manages, and the Company will continue to integrate climate considerations into its risk management framework as its understanding of climate change and risks driven by it evolve.\n",

The decrease in criticized CRE loans was driven by the hotel/motel and shopping center property types, as these property types continued to recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an increase in the office buildings and apartment property types. Criticized CRE loans at December 31, 2022, increased compared with September 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in the office buildings property type. The credit quality of the office buildings property type could continue to be adversely affected if weakened demand for office space continues to drive higher vacancy rates and deteriorating operating performance.

At the end of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 30 years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment increase, which can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the outstanding balance.\n",

As master servicer, our primary duties are typically to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of the mortgage loans by the servicer, and (2) advance delinquent amounts required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform their advancing obligations. The amount and timing of reimbursement for advances of delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable servicing agreements. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about residential and commercial servicing rights, servicer advances and servicing fees. In accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, upon transfer as servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which generally becomes exercisable when three scheduled loan payments remain unpaid by the borrower. We generally repurchase these loans for cash and as a result, our total consolidated assets do not change. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, these repurchased loan balances were $9.8 billion and $17.3 billion, respectively, which included $8.6 billion and $12.9 billion, respectively, in loans held for investment, with the remainder in loans held for sale.\n",
      "Repurchased loans that regain current status or are otherwise modified in accordance with applicable servicing guidelines may be included in future GNMA loan securitization pools. However, in accordance with guidance issued by GNMA, certain loans repurchased after June 30, 2020, are ineligible for inclusion in future GNMA loan securitization pools until the borrower has timely made six consecutive payments. This requirement may delay our ability to transfer loans into the securitization market.

      "servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions we take in such capacity. We are required to indemnify the securitization trustee against any failure by us, as servicer or master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations. In addition, if we commit a breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period. The standards governing servicing in GSE-guaranteed securitizations, and the possible remedies for violations of such standards, vary, and those standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides maintained by the GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and individual servicers and topical guides published by the GSEs from time to time. Such remedies could include indemnification or repurchase of an affected mortgage loan. In addition, in connection with our servicing activities, we could become subject to consent orders and settlement agreements with federal and state regulators for alleged servicing issues and practices. In general, these can require us to provide customers with loan modification relief, refinancing relief, and foreclosure prevention and assistance, and can result in business restrictions or the imposition of certain monetary penalties on us. For example, on September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business.

Primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk Committee of the Board.\n",

      "INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk is the risk that market fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange can cause a loss of the Company’s earnings and capital stemming from mismatches in the Company’s asset and liability cash flows primarily arising from customer-related activities such as lending and deposit-taking. We are subject to interest rate risk because: • assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts; short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs differently; the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, mortgage-related products may pay down at a slower rate than anticipated, which could impact portfolio income; or interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage origination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other financial instruments.\n",
      "Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or lower interest rates. Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit mix is modeled to be the same in the base scenario and the alternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, customer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher yielding products could impact expected net interest income. The interest rate sensitivity of deposits is modeled using the historical behavior of our deposits portfolio and reflects the expectations of deposit products repricing as market interest rates change (referred to as deposit betas). Our actual experience in base and alternative scenarios may differ from expectations due to the lag or acceleration of deposit repricing, changes in consumer behavior, and other factors.\n",

See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to- Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information on the debt securities portfolios. We use derivatives for asset/liability management in two main ways: • to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability instruments/portfolios including investments, commercial loans and long-term debt, from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments, or vice versa; and to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, funded mortgage loans, and MSRs.\n",

However, an increase in interest rates can also reduce mortgage loan demand, including refinancing activity, which reduces noninterest income from origination activities. A decline in interest rates would generally have an opposite impact. To reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, our residential MSRs are economically hedged with a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, Eurodollar futures, highly liquid mortgage forward contracts and interest rate options. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires sophisticated modeling and constant monitoring. There are several potential risks to earnings from mortgage banking related to origination volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and associated hedging results, the relationship and degree of volatility between short-term and long-term interest rates, and changes in servicing and foreclosures costs. While we attempt to balance our mortgage banking interest rate and market risks, the financial instruments we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income being hedged.\n",

We determine whether mortgage loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for investment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability management activities. We may also retain securities in our investment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates may impact mortgage banking noninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and the fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan commitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage applicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our mortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to the time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer demand, as well as the time required for processing a new application, providing the commitment, and securitizing and selling the loan.

During 2022, we issued $1.8 billion of common stock, substantially all of which was issued in connection with employee compensation and benefits. In 2022, we repurchased 110 million shares of common stock at a cost of $6 billion. In 2022, our AOCI decreased $11.7 billion, predominantly due to net unrealized losses on AFS debt securities.

The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding companies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. In addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to establish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing financial distress. Furthermore, to promote a BHC’s safety and soundness and the financial and operational resilience of its operations, the FRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of directors of large BHCs and has proposed related guidance identifying core principles for effective senior management. The OCC, under separate authority, has finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The guidelines also formalize roles and responsibilities for risk management practices within covered banks and create certain risk oversight responsibilities for their boards of directors. In addition to\n",

Regulation of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to ensure that consumers receive clear and accurate disclosures regarding financial products and are protected from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB has issued a number of rules impacting consumer financial products, including rules regarding the origination, servicing, notification, disclosure and other requirements with respect to residential mortgage lending, as well as rules impacting prepaid cards, credit cards, and other financial products and banking-related activities. In addition to these rulemaking activities, the CFPB is continuing its ongoing supervisory examination activities of the financial services industry with respect to a number of consumer businesses and products, including mortgage lending and servicing, fair lending requirements, and auto finance. Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities. The Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter derivatives, and, pursuant to authority granted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have adopted comprehensive sets of rules regulating swaps and security-based swaps, respectively, and the OCC and other federal regulatory agencies have adopted margin requirements for uncleared swaps and security-based swaps. As a provisionally- registered swap dealer and a conditionally-registered security-based swap dealer, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is subject to these rules.

In addition to the Company’s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary, e Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), is also required to prepar and periodically submit a resolution plan.

      "If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly liquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically important financial institution that is in default or in danger of default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is appointed as receiver for the Parent, then the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ claims.\n",

      "To facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important financial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal banking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an orderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, 2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC (“WFCS”), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated from time to time as material entities for resolution planning purposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified from time to time as related support entities in our resolution plan (the “Related Support Entities”). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including the majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and intercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its subsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will continue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered Entities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity and/ or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were not implemented.

      "Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report) are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition because they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies govern: • • • • • • the allowance for credit losses; the valuation of residential MSRs; the fair value of financial instruments; income taxes; liability for contingent litigation losses; and goodwill impairment. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies and the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit Committee. Allowance for Credit Losses We maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management’s estimate of the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt securities classified as either HTM or AFS, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. For loans and HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured based on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset (including off-balance sheet credit exposures) adjusted, as appropriate, for prepayments and permitted extension options using historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted information. For AFS debt securities, the ACL is measured using a discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost. Changes in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision for credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the judgment and review required to determine the ACL, management considerations include the evaluation of past events, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and conditions, customer behavior, collateral values, the length of the initial loss forecast period, and other influences. From time to time, changes in economic factors or assumptions, business strategy, products or product mix, or debt security investment strategy, may result in a corresponding increase or decrease in our ACL. While our methodology attributes portions of the ACL to specific financial asset classes (loan and debt security portfolios) or loan portfolio segments (commercial and consumer), the entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of the Company. • Judgment is specifically applied in: Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast period. We forecast a wide range of economic variables to estimate expected credit losses. Our key economic variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate,\n",
      "and collateral asset prices. While many of these economic variables are evaluated at the macro-economy level, some economic variables are forecasted at more granular levels, for example, using the metro statistical area (MSA) level for unemployment rates, home prices and commercial real estate prices. At least annually, we assess the length of the initial loss forecast period and have currently set the period to two years. For the initial loss forecast period, we forecast multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more pessimistic (downside) scenarios. Management exercises judgment when assigning weight to the economic scenarios that are used to estimate future credit losses. Reversion to historical loss expectations. Our long-term average loss expectations are estimated by reverting to the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the forecasted economic variables. These long-term averages are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis. Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, unfunded credit commitments, and debt securities. Individually assessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit variables in our modeled approaches to help assess probability of default and loss given default. Borrower quality ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial strength and contribute to forecasted probability of default curves. Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted collateral prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted severity of loss in the event of default. These credit risk ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers and subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk specialists. Usage of credit loss estimation models. We use internally developed models that incorporate credit attributes and economic variables to generate credit loss estimates. Management uses judgment and quantitative analytics in the determination of segmentation, modeling approach, and variables that are leveraged in the models. These models are independently validated in accordance with the Company’s policies. We routinely assess our model performance and apply adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy of loss estimation. We also assess our models for limitations against the company-wide risk inventory to help appropriately capture known and emerging risks in our estimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as needed. Valuation of collateral. The current fair value of collateral is utilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial asset is considered to be collateral dependent. We apply judgment when valuing the collateral either through appraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or other quantitative techniques. Decreases in collateral valuations support incremental charge-downs and increases in collateral valuation are included in the ACL as a negative allowance when the financial asset has been previously written-down below current recovery value. Contractual term considerations. The remaining contractual term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We extend the contractual term when we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension\n",

We also incorporate any scenarios where we reasonably expect to provide an extension through a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). indeterminate maturities, which requires that we determine a contractual life by estimating the application of future payments to the outstanding loan amount. Qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models. These amounts represent management’s judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the ACL. We also consider economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. Credit card loans have Sensitivity The ACL for loans is sensitive to changes in key assumptions which requires significant management judgment. Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a variety of ty, factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quali and general forecasted economic conditions. The forecasted t economic variables used could have varying impacts on differen financial assets or portfolios. Additionally, throughout numero us s credit cycles, there are observed changes in economic variable such as the unemployment rate, GDP and real estate prices whic may not move in a correlated manner as variables may move in opposite directions or differ across portfolios or geography. h Our sensitivity analysis does not represent management’s view of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date. We applied a 100% weight to a more severe downside scenario in our sensitivity analysis to reflect the potential for further economic deterioration. The outcome of the scenario was influenced by the duration, severity, and timing of changes in economic variables within the scenario. The sensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the ACL for loans of approximately $7.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The hypothetical increase in our ACL for loans does not incorporate the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the current ACL for loans, which may have a positive or negative effect on the results. It is possible that others performing similar sensitivity analyses could reach different conclusions or results. The sensitivity analysis excludes the ACL for debt securities and other financial assets given its size relative to the overall ACL.

The discount rate used to present value estimated future net servicing income. The discount rate is the required rate of return investors in the market would expect for an asset with similar risk. To determine the discount rate, we consider the risk premium for uncertainties in the cash flow estimates such as from servicing operations (e.g., possible changes in future servicing costs, ancillary income and earnings on escrow accounts). In 2022, we enhanced our approach for estimating the discount rate to a more dynamic methodology for market curves and volatility.

In recent years, there have been significant market- driven fluctuations in loan prepayment rate and the discount rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the future. Additionally, future regulatory or investor changes in servicing standards as well as changes in individual state foreclosure legislation or changes in market participant information regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an impact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation in future periods.

If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value measurement is based upon models that generally use market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment rates, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when observable market data is limited or not available, fair value estimates are typically determined using internal models based on unobservable inputs. Internal models used to determine fair value are validated in accordance with Company policies by an internal model validation group. Additionally, we use third-party pricing services to obtain fair values, which are used to either record the price of an instrument or to corroborate internal prices. Third-party price validation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of the fair value measurements.\n",

      "management judgment is necessary as we make judgments about significant assumptions that market participants would use to estimate fair value. Determination of these assumptions includes consideration of many factors, including market conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value. In such cases, it may be appropriate to adjust available quoted prices or observable market data. For example, we may adjust a price received from a third-party pricing service using internal models based on discounted cash flows when the impact of illiquid markets has not already been incorporated in the fair value measurement. Additionally, for certain residential LHFS and certain debt and equity securities where the significant inputs have become unobservable due to illiquid markets and a third- party pricing service is not used, our discounted cash flow model uses a discount rate that reflects what we believe a market participant would require in light of the illiquid market.\n",
      "We continually assess the level and volume of market activity in our debt and equity security classes in determining adjustments, if any, to quoted prices. Given market conditions can change over time, our determination of which securities markets are considered active or inactive can change. If we determine a market to be inactive, the degree to which quoted prices require adjustment, can also change.\n",

      "Income Taxes We file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we operate and evaluate income tax expense in two components: current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits.\n",
      "Deferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet method and deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and recognizes enacted changes in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the realizable amount.\n",
      "The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate\n",
      "are complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the relevant government taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions.

We allocate capital to the reporting units under a risk- sensitive framework driven by our regulatory capital requirements. We estimate fair value of the reporting units based on a balanced weighting of fair values estimated using both an income approach and a market approach which are intended to reflect Company performance and expectations as well as external market conditions. The methodologies for calculating carrying amounts and estimating fair values are periodically assessed by senior management and revised as necessary.\n",
      "Liability for Contingent Litigation Losses The Company is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory, governmental, arbitration and other proceedings or investigations concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities, and many of those proceedings and investigations expose the Company to potential financial loss or other adverse consequences. We establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if we cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low end of the range of those potential losses. The actual costs of resolving legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those actions.\n",
      "The income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, which estimates the present value of future cash flows associated with each reporting unit. A DCF analysis requires significant judgment to model financial forecasts for our reporting units, which includes future expectations of economic conditions and balance sheet changes, as well as considerations related to future business activities. The forecasts are reviewed by senior management. For periods after our financial forecasts, we incorporate a terminal value estimate based on an assumed long-term growth rate. We discount these forecasted cash flows using a consistent rate derived from the capital asset pricing model which produces an estimated cost of equity for our reporting units, which reflects risks and uncertainties in the financial markets and in our internally generated business projections.\n",

Our judgment in establishing accruals and the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and estimable losses is influenced by our understanding of information currently available related to the legal evaluation and potential outcome of actions, including input and advice on these matters from our internal counsel, external counsel and senior management. These matters may be in various stages of investigation, discovery or proceedings. They may also involve a wide variety of claims across our businesses, legal entities and jurisdictions.

      "Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts and subsequent related updates The Update, effective January 1, 2023, requires market risk benefits (features of insurance contracts that protect the policyholder from other-than-nominal capital market risk and expose the insurer to that risk) to be measured at fair value through earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our own credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income. The Update also requires more frequent updates for insurance assumptions, mandates the use of a standardized discount rate for traditional long-duration contracts, and simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs.\n",
      "We adopted the Update on January 1, 2023, with retroactive application to prior periods. The most significant impact of adoption relates to reinsurance of variable annuity products for a limited number of our insurance clients. Our reinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts. These variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum benefits that require us to make benefit payments for the remainder of the policyholder’s life once the account values are exhausted. These guaranteed minimum benefits meet the definition of market risk benefits and are measured at fair value.\n",
      "At adoption, the effect of the difference between fair value and the carrying value of our market risk benefits, net of income tax adjustments and excluding the impact of our own credit risk, was approximately $325 million as of January 1, 2023. The adjustment increased our retained earnings and regulatory capital amounts and ratios. The adjustment for the impact of our own credit risk recorded as an increase to other comprehensive income was approximately $15 million, net of tax, as of January 1, 2023. We expect future earnings volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits, which are sensitive to changes in equity and fixed income markets, as well as policyholder behavior and changes in mortality assumptions. We economically hedge the market volatility, where feasible.\n",

      "The Update, effective January 1, 2023 (with early adoption permitted), establishes the portfolio layer method, which expands an entity’s ability to achieve fair value hedge accounting for interest rate risk hedges of closed portfolios of financial assets. The Update also provides guidance on the accounting for hedged item basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method.\n",
      "We adopted the Update on January 1, 2023 on a prospective basis. No cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of stockholders’ equity was required upon adoption, as impacts to us were reflected prospectively. The Update improves our ability to use derivatives to hedge interest rate risk exposures associated with portfolios of financial assets, such as fixed-rate available-for-sale debt securities and loans. The Update allows us to hedge a larger proportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type of derivatives permitted as eligible hedges, as well as by increasing the scope of eligible hedged items to include both prepayable and nonprepayable assets.\n",
      "Upon adoption, any election to designate portfolio layer method hedges is applied prospectively. Additionally, the Update permits a one-time reclassification of debt securities from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale classification as long as the securities are designated in a portfolio layer method hedge no later than 30 days after the adoption date.\n",
      "In January 2023, we reclassified fixed-rate debt securities with an aggregate fair value of $23.2 billion and amortized cost of $23.9 billion from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale and designated interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $20.1 billion as fair value hedges using the portfolio layer method. The transfer of debt securities was recorded at fair value and resulted in approximately $566 million of unrealized losses associated with available-for-sale debt securities being recorded to other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes.\n",

These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer loan performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially for those business borrowers that rely on the health of industries that may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The ability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans may deteriorate, causing us, as one of the largest commercial and CRE lenders in the U.S., to incur significantly higher credit losses. In addition, weak or deteriorating economic conditions make it more challenging for us to increase our consumer and commercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy borrowers at attractive yields.

The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy; disrupted global supply chains; affected equity market valuations; and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets and unemployment levels. As a result of the pandemic, the demand for our products and services has, at times, been significantly impacted, which adversely affected our revenue. The pandemic also resulted in the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses, particularly for industries most directly and adversely affected by the pandemic, such as travel and entertainment.\n",

      "The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic further impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. Depending on future developments, the COVID-19 pandemic or any new pandemic could result in the occurrence of new, unanticipated adverse effects on us or the recurrence of adverse effects similar to those already experienced.\n",
      "Changes in interest rates and financial market values could reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, including as a result of recognizing losses on the debt and equity securities that we hold in our portfolio or trade for our customers. Changes in either our net interest margin or the amount or mix of earning assets we hold, including as a result of the asset cap under the February 2018 consent order with the FRB, could affect our net interest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can affect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. If our funding costs rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets or if the yield we earn on our assets falls faster than our funding costs, our net interest margin could contract.\n",
      "The amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect our yield and net interest income. We hold earning assets in the form of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets. As noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our yield and net interest income. In addition, our net interest income and net interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged period of low interest rates as it may result in us holding lower yielding loans and securities on our consolidated balance sheet, particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher yielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. Increases in interest rates, however, may continue to negatively affect loan demand and could result in higher credit losses as borrowers may have more difficulty making higher interest payments. As described below, changes in interest rates also affect our mortgage business, including the value of our MSRs. In an effort to address high inflation, the FRB significantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate and has indicated it may continue to raise it in 2023.\n",

We may hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate derivatives. We also rely on the “natural hedge” that our mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can provide as their revenue impact tends to move in opposite directions based on changes in interest rates.\n",
      "We generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There is always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or option volatility could reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve changes, we may incur significant losses on debt securities we hold as investments. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may rebalance our portfolios of debt securities, equity securities and loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic actions. We may incur losses when we take such actions. In addition, changes in interest rates can result in increased basis risk, which could limit the effectiveness of our hedging activities.\n",
      "Because of changing economic and market conditions, as well as credit ratings, affecting issuers and the performance o f any underlying collateral, we may be required to recognize othe than-temporary impairment (OTTI) in future periods on the securities we hold. Furthermore, the value of the debt securiti we hold can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates, issuer creditworthiness, and other factors. Our net income also is exposed to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices in connection with our trading activities, which are conducted primarily to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers, as well as when we execute economic hedging to manage certain balance sheet risks.

When the yield curve flattens or inverts, our net interest income and net interest margin could decrease if the cost of our short-term funding increases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-term assets.

The administrator of LIBOR ceased publication of LIBOR settings on a representative basis on December 31, 2021, with the exception of the most commonly used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings, which will no longer be published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. Additionally, federal banking regulators issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using USD LIBOR in new contracts. We have a significant number of assets and liabilities, such as legacy commercial loans, adjustable-rate mortgage loans, derivatives, debt securities, and long-term debt, referenced to LIBOR and other interbank offered rates. When any such benchmark rate or other referenced financial metric is significantly changed, replaced or discontinued, or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market benchmark rate or financial metric, there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instrument.\n",

There can be no assurance that any new benchmark rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or other financial metric will be an adequate alternative to LIBOR or produce the economic equivalent of LIBOR. In addition, the transition away from LIBOR will continue to require changes to existing transaction data, products, systems, models, operations, and pricing processes, as well as the modification or renegotiation of contracts that reference USD LIBOR. It may also continue to result in significant operational, systems, or other practical challenges, increased compliance and operational costs, and heightened expectations and scrutiny from regulators, and could result in litigation, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences. Furthermore, the transition away from widely used benchmark rates like LIBOR could result in customers or other market participants challenging the determination of their interest payments, disputing the interpretation or implementation of fallback provisions and other transition related changes, or entering into fewer transactions or postponing their financing needs, which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business.

      "Effective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business, and our financial results and condition could be materially adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liquidity. We primarily rely on customer deposits to be a low-cost and stable source of funding for the loans we make and the operation of our business. In addition to customer deposits, our sources of liquidity include certain debt and equity securities, our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets and to pledge loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and the FRB, and our ability to raise funds in domestic and international money through capital markets.\n",
      "Our liquidity and our ability to fund and run our business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruption and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or our inability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Market disruption and volatility could impact our credit spreads, which are the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of the same maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads could significantly increase our funding costs. Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect our liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in the Company or negative news about the Company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets; our inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; disruptions or volatility in the repurchase market which also may increase our short-term funding costs; regulatory requirements or restrictions; unexpectedly high or accelerated customer draws on lines of credit; and, as described below, reductions in one or more of our credit ratings. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which we have little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. For example, concerns over geopolitical issues, commodity and currency prices, as well as global economic conditions, may cause financial market volatility.\n",

A downgrade of the sovereign debt ratings of the U.S. government or the debt ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, as well as other fiscal or political events could, in addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. government securities that we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well as have other material adverse effects on the operation of our business and our financial results and condition.\n",

      "As noted above, we rely heavily on customer deposits for our funding and liquidity. We compete with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may increase, either because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive other investment opportunities, such as stocks, bonds, or money market mutual funds, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. When customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we may lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and negatively affecting our liquidity. In addition, we may continue to reduce certain deposit balances in order to manage under the asset cap.\n",

      "We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and federal and state law, as well as certain contractual arrangements, can limit those dividends. Wells Fargo & Company, the parent holding company (the “Parent”), is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its funding and liquidity from dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries. We generally use these dividends and distributions, among other things, to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal on our debt. Federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends and distributions that our bank and some of our nonbank subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, may pay to the Parent.

      "Adverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, financial results and condition. Our borrowing costs and ability to obtain funding are influenced by our credit ratings. Reductions in one or more of our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow funds and raise the costs of our borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect our ability to raise funding. Credit ratings and credit ratings agencies’ outlooks are based on the ratings agencies’ analysis of many quantitative and qualitative factors, such as our capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of our earnings, rating agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support, and other rating agency specific criteria. In addition to credit ratings, our borrowing costs are affected by various other external factors, including market volatility and concerns or perceptions about the financial services industry generally. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our credit ratings and outlooks and that credit ratings downgrades in the future would not materially affect our ability to borrow funds and borrowing costs. Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger additional collateral or funding obligations which, depending on the severity of the downgrade, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, including as a result of credit-related contingent features in certain of our derivative contracts.\n",

Our parent company, our subsidiary banks and many of our nonbank subsidiaries such as those related to our brokerage business, are subject to significant and extensive regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as well as the applicable laws of the various jurisdictions outside of the U.S. where they conduct business. These regulations generally protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, consumers, investors, employees, or the banking and financial system as a whole, not necessarily our security holders. Economic, market and political conditions during the past few years have led to a significant amount of legislation and regulation in the U.S. and abroad affecting the financial services industry, as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of financial services companies from banking regulators.

The FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ claims.\n",

      "In addition, as part of its obligation to impose enhanced capital and risk-management standards on large financial firms pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB has issued a capital plan rule that establishes capital planning and other requirements that govern capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including Wells Fargo. The FRB has also finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and\n",

      "imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. In addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to establish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing financial distress and has proposed additional requirements regarding effective risk management practices at large BHCs, including its expectations for boards of directors and senior management. The OCC, under separate authority, has also established heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks, such as the Bank. The Basel standards and federal regulatory capital, leverage, liquidity, TLAC, capital planning, and other requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases, and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, including due to changes in regulatory requirements, such as through the adoption or implementation of new or revised Basel standards, or as a result of business growth, acquisitions or a change in our risk profile, could require us to liquidate assets or otherwise change our business, product offerings and/or investment plans, which may negatively affect our financial results. Although not currently anticipated, new capital requirements and/or our regulators may require us to raise additional capital in the future. Issuing additional common stock may dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. In addition, federal banking regulations may continue to increase our compliance costs as well as limit our ability to invest in our business or provide loans or other products and services to our customers.\n",

      "FRB policies, including policies on interest rates, can significantly affect business and economic conditions and our financial results and condition. The FRB regulates the supply of money in the United States. Its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest income and net interest margin. The FRB’s interest rate policies also can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold, such as debt securities and MSRs. In addition, its policies can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in FRB policies, including its target range for the federal funds rate or actions taken to increase or decrease the size of its balance sheet, are beyond our control and can be hard to predict. The FRB significantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate and has indicated it may continue to raise it in 2023 to address high inflation. As noted above, changes in the interest rate environment and yield curve which may result from the FRB’s actions could negatively affect our net interest income and net interest margin.\n",
      "CREDIT RISKS\n",
      "Increased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions or changes in market conditions, could require us to increase our provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse\n",
      "effect on our results of operations and financial condition. When we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., the credit performance of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results and condition. We also incur credit risk in connection with trading and other activities. As noted above, if the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers and counterparties may have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio (including unfunded credit commitments). The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions, including falling home prices, higher unemployment or inflation, significant loan growth, changes in consumer behavior, or other market conditions that adversely affect borrowers, or other factors. Additionally, the regulatory environment or external factors, such as natural disasters, disease pandemics, political or social matters, or trade policies, also can influence recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and impact our allowance for credit losses.\n",
      "Future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic conditions. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2022, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses. In the event of significant deterioration in economic conditions or if we experience significant loan growth, we may be required to build reserves in future periods, which would reduce our earnings. For additional information, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” sections in this Report.\n",
      "We may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral. Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or to borrowers who individually or as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions. Similarly, challenging economic or market conditions, or trade policies, affecting a particular industry or geography may also impact related or dependent industries or the ability of borrowers living in such affected areas or working in such industries to meet their financial obligations. We experienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010 when we incurred greater than expected losses in our residential real estate loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater than expected deterioration in residential real estate values in many markets, including the Central Valley California market and several Southern California metropolitan statistical areas. As California is our largest banking state in terms of loans and deposits, deterioration in real estate values and underlying economic conditions in those markets or elsewhere in California could result in materially higher credit losses. In addition, changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions may adversely affect borrowers in certain industries or sectors, which may\n",

      "Risk Factors (continued)\n",
      "increase our credit risk and reduce the demand by these borrowers for our products and services. Moreover, deterioration in macro-economic conditions generally across the country could result in materially higher credit losses, including for our residential real estate loan portfolio, which includes nonconforming mortgage loans we retain on our balance sheet. We may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates as our consumer real estate secured lines of credit reach their contractual end of draw period and begin to amortize.\n",
      "We are currently one of the largest CRE lenders in the U.S. A deterioration in economic conditions that negatively affects the business performance of our CRE borrowers, including increases in interest rates, declines in commercial property values, and/or changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions, such as a continued decrease in the demand for office space, could result in materially higher credit losses and have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition.\n",
      "Challenges and/or changes in non-U.S. economic conditions\n",
      "may increase our non-U.S. credit risk. Economic difficulties in non-U.S. jurisdictions could also indirectly have a material adverse effect on our credit performance and results of operations and financial condition to the extent they negatively affect the U.S. economy and/or our borrowers who have non-U.S. operations.\n",
      "derivative transactions through central counterparty clearinghouses (CCPs), which results in credit exposure to thes CCPs. Similarly, because we are a member of various CCPs, we may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the CCP in the event that one or more members of the CCP defaults non- on its obligations. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of performance by our clients for which we clear transactions through CCPs to the extent such non-performance is not sufficiently covered by available collateral.\n",

Furthermore, enhancements and upgrades to our infrastructure or operating systems may be time-consuming, entail significant costs, and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process of enhancing our infrastructure and operating systems, including their security measures and controls, can itself create a risk of system disruptions and security issues. Similarly, we may not be able to timely recover critical business processes or operations that have been disrupted, which may further increase any associated costs and consequences of such disruptions. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place to help provide operational resiliency, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers. For example, on February 7, 2019, we experienced system issues caused by an automatic power shutdown at one of our main data center facilities. Although applications and related workloads were systematically re-routed to back-up data centers throughout the day, certain of our services, including our online and mobile banking systems, certain mortgage origination systems, and certain ATM functions, experienced disruptions that delayed service to our customers.\n",

      "A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, controls or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, could disrupt our businesses, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. As a large financial institution that serves customers through numerous physical locations, ATMs, the internet, mobile banking and other distribution channels across the U.S. and internationally, we depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis. As our customer base and locations have expanded throughout the U.S. and internationally, as we have increasingly used the internet and mobile banking to provide products and services to our customers, as customer, public, legislative and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, and as cyber and other information security attacks have become more prevalent and complex, our operational systems, controls and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing systems or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly, become insufficient based on our evolving business needs, or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control.

These risks are heightened to the extent we rely on a single third party or on third parties in a single geographic area. We are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other operational incident at a common service provider to our third parties could impede their ability to provide services or perform their responsibilities for us. In addition, we must meet regulatory requirements and expectations regarding our use of third-party service providers, and any failure by our third-party service providers to meet their obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, or Wells Fargo policies could result in fines, penalties, restrictions on our business, or other negative consequences.\n",

      "A cyber attack or other information security incident could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or reputation. Information security risks for large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet, mobile devices, and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, the increase in remote work arrangements, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Those parties also may continue to attempt to misrepresent personal or financial information to commit fraud, obtain loans or other financial products from us, or attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose confidential, proprietary, or other information to gain access to our data or that of our customers. Geopolitical matters, such as the conflict in Ukraine, may also elevate the risk of an information security threat, particularly by foreign state-sponsored parties or their supporters. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our banking, brokerage, investment advisory, and capital markets businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, hardware, and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Our technologies, systems, software, networks, and our customers’ devices continue to be the target of cyber attacks or other information security threats, which could materially adversely affect us, including as a result of fraudulent activity, the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or the disruption of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ or other third parties’ business operations. For example, various retailers have reported they were victims of cyber attacks in which large amounts of their customers’ data, including debit and credit card information, was obtained. In these situations, we generally incur costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent transaction activity affecting our customers. We are also exposed to the risk that an employee or other person acting on behalf of the Company fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures and inappropriately circumvents information security controls for personal gain or other improper purposes.\n",
      "compromised due to information security incidents affecting those third parties.\n",
      "remains heightened because of, among other things, the persistent and evolving nature of these threats, the prominent size and scale of Wells Fargo and its role in the financial services industry, our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how they want to be served, our geographic footprint and international presence, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, and the current global economic and political environment. For example, Wells Fargo and other financial institutions, as well as our third-party service providers, continue to be the target of various evolving and adaptive information security threats, including cyber attacks, malware, ransomware, other malicious software intended to exploit hardware or software vulnerabilities, phishing, credential validation, and distributed denial-of-service, in an effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions, test their cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also focused on targeting online applications and services, such as online banking, as well as cloud-based and other products and services provided by third parties, and have targeted the infrastructure of the internet, causing the widespread unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As a result, information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and systems designed to protect our networks, computers, software and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for Wells Fargo. We are also proactively involved in industry cybersecurity efforts and working with other parties, including our third-party service providers and governmental agencies, to continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency to information security threats. As these threats continue to evolve, we expect to continue to be required to expend significant resources to develop and enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Because the investigation of any information security breach is inherently unpredictable and would require time to complete, we may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a breach, which may further increase any associated costs and consequences. Moreover, to the extent our insurance covers aspects of information security risk, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities or losses associated with an information security breach.\n",

However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or managed. Our risk management framework is also dependent on ensuring that effective operational controls and a sound culture exist throughout the Company. The inability to develop effective operational controls or to foster the appropriate culture in each of our lines of business, including the inability to align performance management and compensation to achieve the desired culture, could adversely impact the effectiveness of our risk management framework. Similarly, if we are unable to effectively manage our business or operations, we may be exposed to increased risks or unexpected losses. We process a large number of transactions each day and are exposed to risks or losses if we do not accurately or completely execute a process or transaction, whether due to human error or otherwise; if we are unable to detect and prevent fraudulent activity; or if an employee or third-party service provider fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures, inappropriately circumvents controls, or engages in other misconduct.\n",

If we are unable to meet any ongoing obligations under these settlements, we may incur additional monetary or other penalties or be required to make admissions of wrongdoing and comply with other conditions, which can lead to restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or services, limitations on our ability to access capital markets, limitations on capital distributions, the loss of customers, and/or other adverse consequences. Any inability to meet our ongoing obligations under these settlements, depending on the sanctions and remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, negative publicity or public opinion resulting from these matters may increase the risk of reputational harm to our business, which can impact our ability to keep and attract customers, affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, result in the loss of revenue, or have other material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.\n",

Furthermore, certain of our models are subject to regulatory review and approval, and any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations could result in fines, penalties, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities, or other adverse consequences, and any required modifications or changes to these models can impact our capital ratios and requirements and result in increased operational and compliance costs. In addition, we rely on data to aggregate and assess our various risk exposures and business activities, and any issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data, including our aggregation, management, and validation procedures, could result in ineffective risk management practices, business decisions or customer service, inefficient use of resources, or inaccurate regulatory or other risk reporting. We also use artificial intelligence to help further inform or automate our business decisions and risk management practices, but there is no assurance that artificial intelligence will appropriately or sufficiently replicate certain outcomes or human assessment or accurately predict future events or exposures. Previous financial and credit crises and resulting regulatory reforms highlighted both the importance and some of the limitations of managing unanticipated risks, and our regulators remain focused on ensuring that financial institutions, and Wells Fargo in particular, build and maintain robust risk management policies and practices. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\n",

Negative public opinion about the financial services industry generally or Wells Fargo specifically could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to keep and attract customers. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including sales practices; mortgage, auto or other consumer lending practices; loan origination or servicing activities; mortgage foreclosure actions; management of client accounts or investments; lending, investing or other business relationships; identification and management of potential conflicts of interest from transactions, obligations and interests with and among our customers; environmental, social and governance practices; regulatory compliance; risk management; incentive compensation practices; and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection or improper use of customer information, and from actions taken by government regulators and community or other organizations in response to that conduct.

Climate change related impacts could also negatively affect the financial condition of our customers, increase the credit risk associated with those customers, or result in the deterioration of the value of the collateral we hold. In addition, changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions on account of climate considerations or due to the transition to a low carbon economy may adversely affect customers in certain industries, sectors or geographies, which may increase our credit risk and reduce the demand by these customers for our products and services. Furthermore, the transition to a low carbon economy could affect our business practices or result in additional costs or other adverse consequences to our business operations. Legislation and/or regulation in connection with climate change, as well as stakeholder perceptions and expectations related to climate change and its impacts, could require us to change certain of our business and/or risk management practices, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our operations and business. Moreover, our reputation may be damaged as a result of our response to climate change or our strategy for the transition to a low carbon economy, including if we are unable or perceived to be unable to achieve our objectives or if our response is disliked, disfavored, or perceived to be ineffective or insufficient.

Wells Fargo and some of its subsidiaries are involved in judicial, regulatory, governmental, arbitration, and other proceedings or investigations concerning matters arising from the conduct of our business activities, and many of those proceedings and investigations expose Wells Fargo to potential financial loss or other adverse consequences. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any of these legal actions.

We may still incur costs for a legal action even if we have not established an accrual. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a\n",

      "MORTGAGE BUSINESS RISKS\n",
      "Our mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to quarter, including from the impact of changes in interest rates, and we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming loans to reduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to fund new mortgage loans. We earn revenue from fees we receive for originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates can affect these fees, as well as the fair value of our MSRs. When rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from loan originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our MSRs can increase due to a decline in the likelihood of prepayments, which increases the fair value of our MSRs. When rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase and the value of our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with some offsetting revenue effect. Even though they can act as a “natural hedge,” the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing.\n",
      "We typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge our mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. Hedging is not a perfect science, and we could incur significant losses from our hedging activities.\n",
      "We rely on the GSEs to purchase mortgage loans that meet their conforming loan requirements and on government insuring agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to insure or guarantee loans that meet their policy requirements. If the GSEs or government insuring agencies were to limit or reduce their purchasing, insuring or guaranteeing of loans, our ability to fund, and thus originate, new mortgage loans, could be reduced. We cannot assure that the GSEs or government insuring agencies will not materially limit their purchases, insuring or guaranteeing of conforming loans or change their criteria for what constitutes a conforming loan (e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower eligibility). As noted above, there are various proposals to reform the housing finance market in the U.S., including the role of the GSEs in the housing finance market. The impact of any such regulatory reform regarding the housing finance market and the GSEs, as well as any effect on the Company’s business and financial results, are uncertain. In addition, to meet customer needs, we also originate loans that do not conform to either the GSEs’ or government insuring agencies’ standards, which are generally retained on our balance sheet and therefore do not generate sale proceeds that could be used to originate new loans.\n",

      "We may suffer losses, penalties, or other adverse consequences if we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect to the residential mortgage loans we originate or service. For residential mortgage loans that we originate, we could become subject to monetary damages and other civil penalties, including the loss of certain contractual payments or the inability to exercise certain remedies under the loans such as foreclosure proceedings, if it is alleged or determined that the loans were not originated in accordance with applicable laws or regulations. Additionally, for residential mortgage loans that we\n",

We establish a mortgage repurchase liability that reflects management’s estimate of losses for loans for which we have a repurchase obligation. Because the level of the liability depends on economic factors and other external conditions, the level of the liability is difficult to estimate, requires considerable management judgment, and is subject to change. If economic conditions or the housing market worsen, we could have increased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on repurchases, requiring significant additions to the repurchase liability.\n",

      "We face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry. We compete with other financial institutions in a highly competitive industry that is undergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny, and current economic conditions. Our success depends on, among other things, our ability to develop and maintain deep and enduring relationships with our customers based on the quality of our customer service, the wide variety of products and services that we can offer our customers and the ability of those products and services to satisfy our customers’ needs and preferences, the pricing of our products and services, the extensive distribution channels available for our customers, our innovation, and our reputation. Continued or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may negatively affect our customer relationships, market share and results of operations and/or cause us to increase our capital investment in our businesses in order to remain competitive. In addition, our ability to reposition or reprice our products and services from time to time may be limited and could be influenced significantly by the current economic, regulatory and political environment for large financial institutions as well as by the actions of our competitors. Furthermore, any changes in the types of products and services that we offer our customers and/or the pricing for those products and services could result in a loss of customer relationships and market share and could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\n",

      "We may also incur costs, liabilities to borrowers and/or securitization investors, legal proceedings, or other adverse consequences if we fail to meet our servicing obligations, including with respect to mortgage foreclosure actions or if we experience delays in the foreclosure process. Our net servicing income and the fair value of our MSRs may be negatively affected to the extent our servicing costs increase because of higher foreclosure or other servicing related costs. In addition, we may continue to be subject to fines, business restrictions, and other sanctions imposed by federal or state regulators as a result of actual or perceived deficiencies in our mortgage servicing practices, including with respect to our foreclosure practices, our loss mitigation activities such as loan modifications or forbearances, or our servicing of flood zone properties. Any of these actions may harm our reputation, negatively affect our residential mortgage origination or servicing business, or result in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies, or other enforcement actions. We may also face risks, including regulatory, compliance, and market risks, as we pursue our previously announced plans to reduce the amount of residential mortgage loans we service.\n",

We may not respond effectively to these and other competitive threats from existing and new competitors and may be forced to sell products at lower prices, increase our investment in our business to modify or adapt our existing products and services, and/or develop new products and services to respond to our customers’ needs and preferences.

      "The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires our management to evaluate the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual report on Form 10-K, the existence of any “material weaknesses” in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we will not identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our reputation or stock price of disclosure of a material weakness. We could also be required to devote significant resources to remediate any material weakness. In addition, our customers may rely on the effectiveness of certain of our operational and internal controls as a service provider, and any deficiency in those controls could affect our customers and damage our reputation or business. Sarbanes-Oxley also limits the types of non-audit services our outside auditors may provide to us in order to preserve their independence from us. If our auditors were found not to be independent of us, we could be required to engage new auditors and re-file financial statements and audit reports with the SEC.

Several of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.

We provide banking, investment and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, through banking locations and offices, the internet and other distribution channels to individuals, businesses and institutions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in countries outside the U.S. When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells Fargo & Company (the Parent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding company. We also hold a majority interest in a real estate investment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock outstanding.\n",
      "Our accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in the financial services industry. To prepare the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make estimates based on assumptions about future economic and market conditions (for example, unemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, income and expenses during the reporting period and the related disclosures. Although our estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Management has made significant estimates in several areas, including: •\n",

Prior to ASU 2016-02, variable lease payments were excluded from the definition of lease payments for lessors measuring their net investment loss in a sales-type lease or direct financing lease.

Investments in debt securities for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as HTM. HTM debt securities are measured at amortized cost, net of ACL. See Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) for additional information.\n",
      "Trading Activities We engage in trading activities to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers. These activities predominantly occur in our Corporate and Investment Banking reportable operating segment. Trading assets and liabilities include debt securities, equity securities, loans held for sale, derivatives and short sales, which are reported within our consolidated balance sheet based on the accounting classification of the instrument. In addition, debt securities that are held for investment purposes that we have elected to account for under the fair value method, are classified as trading.\n",
      "INTEREST INCOME AND GAIN/LOSS RECOGNITION Unamortized premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income over the contractual life of the security using the effective interest method, except for purchased callable debt securities carried at a premium. For purchased callable debt securities carried at a premium, the premium is amortized into interest income to the next call date using the effective interest method. As principal repayments are received on securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities (MBS)), a proportionate amount of the related premium or discount is recognized in income so that the effective interest rate on the remaining portion of the security continues unchanged.\n",
      "Our trading assets and liabilities are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net gains from trading and securities within noninterest income. Interest income and interest expense are recognized in net interest income.\n",
      "We recognize realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities in net gains from trading and securities within noninterest income using the specific identification method.\n",
      "Customer accommodation trading activities include our actions as an intermediary to buy and sell financial instruments and market-making activities. We also take positions to manage our exposure to customer accommodation activities. We hold financial instruments for trading in long positions, as well as short positions, to facilitate our trading activities. As an intermediary, we interact with market buyers and sellers to facilitate the purchase and sale of financial instruments to meet the anticipated or current needs of our customers. For example, we may purchase or sell a derivative to a customer who wants to manage interest rate risk exposure. We typically enter into an offsetting derivative or security position to manage our exposure to the customer transaction. We earn income based on the transaction price difference between the customer transaction and the offsetting position, which is reflected in earnings where the fair value changes and related interest income and expense of the positions are recorded.\n",
      "IMPAIRMENT AND CREDIT LOSSES Unrealized losses on AFS debt securities are driven by a number of factors, including changes in interest rates and credit spreads which impact most types of debt securities, and prepayment rates which impact MBS and collateralized loan obligations (CLO). Additional considerations for certain types of AFS debt securities include: •\n",
      "Debt securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, including federal agency MBS, are not impacted by credit movements given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. government. Debt securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions are most impacted by changes in the relationship between municipal and term funding credit curves rather than by changes in the credit quality of the underlying securities. Structured securities, such as MBS and CLO, are also impacted by changes in projected collateral losses of assets underlying the security.\n",
      "Our market-making activities include taking long and short\n",
      "trading positions to facilitate customer order flow. These activities are typically executed on a short-term basis.

See the “Allowance for Credit Losses” section in this Note for our accounting policies relating to the ACL for debt securities, which also includes debt securities classified as HTM.\n",
      "TRANSFERS BETWEEN C ATEGORIES OF DEBT S of debt securities from the AFS to HTM classification are recorded at fair value, and accordingly the amortized cost of t security transferred to HTM gains or losses reported in AOCI at the transfer date are amortized into earnings over the same period as the unamortize premiums and discounts using the effective interest method. Any ACL previously recorded under the AFS debt security model - is reversed and an ACL under the HTM debt security model is re established. The reversal and re-establishment of the ACL are recorded in provision for credit losses.\n",

The reversal and re - establishment of the ACL are recorded in Transfers from HTM to AFS are limited circumstances.\n",
      "NONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE, AND CHARGE-OFF POLICIES We generally place debt securities on nonaccrual status using factors similar to those described for loans. When we place a debt security on nonaccrual status, we reverse the accrued unpaid interest receivable against interest income and suspend the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. If the ultimate collectability of the principal is in doubt on a nonaccrual debt security, any cash collected is first applied to reduce the security’s amortized cost basis to zero, followed by recovery of amounts previously charged off, and subsequently to interest income. Generally, we return a debt security to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal become current under the contractual terms of the security and collectability of remaining principal and interest is no longer doubtful. Our debt securities are considered past due when\n",

      "Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale (LHFS) generally includes commercial and residential mortgage loans originated or purchased for sale in the securitization or whole loan market. We have elected the fair value option for a majority of residential LHFS (see Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities)). The remaining residential LHFS are held at the lower of cost or fair value (LOCOM) and are measured on a pool level basis.\n",
      "Commercial LHFS are generally held at LOCOM and are\n",
      "measured on an individual loan basis. We have elected the fair value option for certain commercial loans included in LHFS that are used in market-making activities for our trading business. Gains and losses on residential and commercial mortgage LHFS are generally recorded in mortgage banking noninterest income. Gains and losses on trading LHFS are recognized in net gains from trading activities. Gains and losses on other LHFS are recognized in other noninterest income. Direct loan origination costs and fees for LHFS under the fair value option are recognized in earnings at origination. For LHFS recorded at LOCOM, direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at origination and are recognized in earnings at time of sale. Interest income on LHFS is calculated based upon the note rate of the loan and is recorded in interest income.\n",
      "Commitments to originate mortgage LHFS are accounted\n",

When a determination is made at the time of commitment to originate loans as held for investment, it is our intent to hold these loans to maturity or for the foreseeable future, subject to periodic review under our management evaluation processes, including corporate asset/liability management. If subsequent changes occur, including changes in interest rates, our business strategy, or other market conditions, we may change our intent to hold these loans. When management makes this determination, we immediately transfer these loans to the LHFS portfolio at LOCOM.\n",
      "Securities and Other Collateralized Financing Agreements Resale and repurchase agreements, as well as securities borrowing and lending agreements, are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the acquisition or sale price plus accrued interest.

      "NONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE LOANS We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when: • the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the borrower’s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, if any), such as in bankruptcy or other circumstances; they are 90 days (120 days with respect to residential mortgage loans) past due for interest or principal, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; part of the principal balance has been charged off; or for junior lien mortgage loans, we have evidence that the related first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in the process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien delinquency status. • • • Credit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status, but are generally fully charged off when the loan reaches 180 days past due. When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse the accrued unpaid interest receivable against interest income and suspend amortization of any net deferred fees. If the ultimate collectability of the recorded loan balance is in doubt on a nonaccrual loan, the cost recovery method is used and cash collected is applied to first reduce the carrying value of the loan to zero and then as a recovery of prior charge-offs. Otherwise, interest income may be recognized to the extent cash is received. Generally, we return a loan to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal become current under the terms of the loan agreement and collectability of remaining principal and interest is no longer doubtful. We may re-underwrite modified loans at the time of a restructuring to determine if there is sufficient evidence of sustained repayment capacity based on the borrower’s financial strength, including documented income, debt to income ratios and other factors. If the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms and the underwriting process shows the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will generally remain in accruing status. When a loan classified as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) performs in accordance with its modified terms, the loan either continues to accrue interest (for performing loans) or will return to accrual status after the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance (generally six consecutive months of payments, or equivalent, inclusive of consecutive payments made prior to the modification). Loans will be placed on nonaccrual status and a corresponding charge-off is recorded if the re-underwriting did not include an evaluation of the borrower’s ability to repay or we believe it is probable that principal and interest contractually due under the modified terms of the agreement will not be collectible.\n",

These modified terms may include interest rate reductions, principal forgiveness, term extensions, payment forbearance and other actions intended to minimize our economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, if applicable. For modifications where we forgive principal, the entire amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately charged off. If the underwriting for a TDR modification did not include an evaluation of the borrower’s ability to repay, the loan is deemed collateral dependent.

Long-term average loss expectations estimated by reverting to the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the economic variables forecasted during the initial loss forecast period. These long-term averages are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis.\n",

For financial assets with an ACL estimated using DCF methods, changes in the ACL due to the passage of time are recorded in interest income. The ACL for AFS debt securities reflects the amount of unrealized loss related to expected credit losses, limited by the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis (fair value floor) and cannot have an associated negative allowance.\n",

      "For financial assets that are collateral-dependent, we will measure the ACL based on the fair value of the collateral. If we intend to sell the underlying collateral, we will measure the ACL based on the collateral’s net realizable value. In most situations, based on our charge-off policies, we will immediately write-down the financial asset to the fair value of the collateral or net realizable value. For consumer loans, collateral-dependent financial assets may have collateral in the form of residential real estate, autos or other personal assets. For commercial loans, collateral-dependent financial assets may have collateral in the form of commercial real estate or other business assets.\n",

Accrued interest receivables are included in other assets, except for certain revolving loans, such as credit card loans.\n",
      "CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY For consumer loans, we determine the allowance using a pooled approach based on the individual risk characteristics of the loans within those pools. Quantitative modeling methodologies that estimate probability of default, loss severity at the time of default and exposure at default are typically leveraged to estimate expected loss. These methodologies pool loans, generally by product types with similar risk characteristics, such as residential real estate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. As appropriate and to achieve greater accuracy, we may further stratify selected portfolios by sub-product, risk pool, loss type, geographic location and other predictive characteristics. We use attributes such as delinquency status, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, and loan-to-value ratios (where applicable) in the development of our consumer loan models, in addition to home price trends, unemployment trends, and other economic variables that may influence the frequency and severity of losses in the consumer portfolio.\n",
      "OTHER QUALITATIVE FACTORS The ACL includes amounts for qualitative factors which may not be adequately reflected in our loss models. These amounts represent management’s judgment of risks in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the ACL.

Probability of default, loss severity at the time of default, and exposure at default are statistically derived through historical observations of default and losses after default within each credit risk rating.

Many of these financial assets are generally not expected to have an ACL as there is a zero loss expectation (e.g., government guarantee) based on no historical credit losses and consideration of current and forecasted conditions.

However, if we determine it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, we complete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is goodwill impairment. We apply various quantitative valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow and earnings multiple approaches, to determine the estimated fair value, which is compared with the carrying value of each reporting unit. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized if the fair value is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill.

The entire gain or loss on these derivatives is included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\n",
      "process includes linking all derivatives designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions. We assess hedge effectiveness using regression analysis, both at inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. For fair value hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing the periodic change in fair value of the hedging instrument against the periodic changes in fair value of the asset or liability being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). For cash flow hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing the periodic changes in fair value of the hedging instrument against the periodic changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative. The hypothetical derivative has terms that identically match and offset the cash flows of the forecasted transaction being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). The initial assessment for fair value and cash flow hedges includes an evaluation of the quantitative measures of the regression results used to validate the conclusion of high effectiveness. Periodically, as required, we also formally assess whether the derivative we designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item using the regression analysis method.\n",
      "DISCONTINUING HEDGE ACCOUNTING We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (1) a derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item, (2) a derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, (3) we elect to discontinue hedge accounting, or (4) when the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring in a cash flow hedge.\n",
      "When we discontinue fair value hedge accounting, we no longer adjust the previously hedged asset or liability for changes in fair value. The remaining cumulative adjustments to the hedged item and accumulated amounts reported in OCI are accounted for in the same manner as other components of the carrying amount of the asset or liability. For example, for financial debt instruments such as AFS debt securities, loans or long-term debt, these amounts are amortized into net interest income over the remaining life of the asset or liability similar to other amortized cost basis adjustments. If the hedged item is derecognized, the accumulated amounts reported in OCI are immediately reclassified to net interest income. If the derivative continues to be held after fair value hedge accounting ceases, we carry the derivative on the consolidated balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair value included in noninterest income. When we discontinue cash flow hedge accounting and it is\n",
      "probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the accumulated amount reported in OCI at the de-designation date continues to be reported in OCI until the forecasted transaction affects earnings at which point the related OCI amount is reclassified to net interest income. If cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued and it is probable the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, the accumulated gains and losses reported in OCI at the de-designation date is immediately reclassified to noninterest income. If the derivative continues to be held after cash flow hedge accounting ceases, we carry the derivative on our consolidated balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair value included in noninterest income.\n",

If the embedded derivative meets all of these conditions, we separate it from the hybrid contract by recording the bifurcated derivative at fair value and the remaining host contract at the difference between the basis of the hybrid instrument and the fair value of the bifurcated derivative. The bifurcated derivative is carried at fair value with changes recorded in noninterest income and reported on our consolidated balance sheet as a derivative asset or liability. The accounting for the remaining host contract is the same as other assets and liabilities of a similar type and reported on our consolidated balance sheet based upon the accounting classification of the instrument.\n",
      "COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK AND NETTING By using derivatives, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as expected. If a counterparty fails to perform, our counterparty credit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset on our consolidated balance sheet. The amounts reported as a derivative asset are derivative contracts in a gain position, and to the extent subject to legally enforceable master netting arrangements, net of derivatives in a loss position with the same counterparty and cash collateral received. We minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, executing master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. Counterparty credit risk related to derivatives is considered in determining fair value and our assessment of hedge effectiveness. To the extent derivatives subject to master netting arrangements meet the applicable requirements, including determining the legal enforceability of the arrangement, it is our policy to present derivative balances and related cash collateral amounts net on our consolidated balance sheet. We incorporate adjustments to reflect counterparty credit risk (credit valuation adjustments (CVA)) in determining the fair value of our derivatives. CVA, which considers the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements, reflects market-based views of the credit quality of each counterparty. We estimate CVA based on observed credit spreads in the credit default swap market and indices indicative of the credit quality of the counterparties to our derivatives.\n",
      "Cash collateral exchanged related to our interest rate derivatives, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, with centrally cleared counterparties is recorded as a reduction of the derivative fair value asset and liability balances, as opposed to separate non-derivative receivables or payables. This cash collateral, also referred to as variation margin, is exchanged based upon derivative fair value changes, typically on a one-day lag. For additional information on our derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 14 (Derivatives).\n",
      "Nonmarketable equity securities do not have readily determinable fair values. These securities are accounted for under one of the following accounting methods: •\n",
      "Fair value through net income: This method is an election. The securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses recognized in net gains from trading and securities in noninterest income; Equity method: This method is applied when we have the ability to exert significant influence over the investee. The securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for our share of the investee’s earnings or losses, less any dividends received and/or impairments. Equity method adjustments for our share of the investee’s earnings or losses are recognized in other noninterest income and dividends are recognized as a reduction of the investment carrying value; Proportional amortization method: This method is applied to certain low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments. The investments are initially recorded at cost and amortized in proportion to the tax credits received. The amortization of the investments and the related tax impacts are recognized in income tax expense; Cost method: This method is required for specific securities, such as Federal Reserve Bank stock and Federal Home Loan Bank stock. These securities are held at cost less any impairments; Measurement alternative: This method is followed by all remaining nonmarketable equity securities. These securities are initially recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value as of the date of an orderly observable transaction of the same or similar security of the same issuer. These securities are also adjusted for impairments.\n",
      "All realized and unrealized gains and losses, including impairment losses, from nonmarketable equity securities are recognized in net gains from trading and securities in noninterest income. Dividend income from all nonmarketable equity securities, other than equity method securities, is recognized in interest income.\n",
      "securities not carried at fair value includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each security, the intent or requirement to sell the security, the expectations of cash flows, capital needs and the viability of its business model. When the fair value of an equity method or cost method investment is less than its carrying value, we write-down the asset to fair value when we consider declines in value to be other than temporary. When the fair value of an investment accounted for using the measurement alternative is less than its carrying value, we write- down the asset to fair value, without the consideration of anticipated recovery.\n",
      "See Note 4 (Equity Securities) for additional information.\n",
      "Equity Securities Equity securities exclude investments that represent a controlling interest in the investee. Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values and are predominantly used in our trading activities. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in net gains from trading and securities in noninterest income. Dividend income from marketable equity securities is recognized in interest income.\n",
      "Pension Accounting We sponsor a frozen noncontributory qualified defined benefit retirement plan, the Wells Fargo & Company Cash Balance Plan (Cash Balance Plan), which covers eligible employees of Wells Fargo. We also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit plans that provide supplemental defined benefit pension benefits to certain eligible employees. We account for our defined benefit pension plans using an actuarial model. Principal assumptions used in determining the net periodic pension cost and the pension obligation include the discount rate, the expected long- term rate of return on plan assets and projected mortality rates. A single weighted-average discount rate is used to estimate\n",
      "the present value of our future pension benefit obligations. We\n",

      "\n",
      "determine the discount rate using a yield curve derived from a broad-based population of high-quality corporate bonds with maturity dates that closely match the estimated timing of the expected benefit payments.\n",
      "Stock-Based Compensation Our long-term incentive plans provide awards for employee services in various forms, such as restricted share rights (RSRs) and performance share awards (PSAs).\n",
      "On December 31, 2021, we changed the method used to estimate the interest cost component of pension expense for our principal defined benefit and postretirement plans to the full yield curve approach. The full yield curve approach aligns specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected benefit payment cash flows. This change does not affect the measurement of our pension obligation as the change in interest cost is offset in the actuarial gain (loss). We accounted for this change prospectively as a change in estimate to our pension expense. Previously, we estimated the interest cost component utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate. We made this change to improve the correlation between the yield curve and the projected benefit payment cash flows.\n",
      "Stock-based awards are measured at fair value on the grant\n",
      "date. The cost is recognized in personnel expense, net of actual forfeitures, in our consolidated statement of income normally over the vesting period of the award; awards with graded vesting are expensed on a straight-line method. Awards to employees who are retirement eligible at the grant date are subject to immediate expensing upon grant. Awards to employees who become retirement eligible before the final vesting date are expensed between the grant date and the date the employee becomes retirement eligible. Except for retirement and other limited circumstances, RSRs are canceled when employment ends.\n",
      "on plan assets is highly quantitative by nature. We evaluate the current asset allocations and expected returns using forward- looking capital market assumptions. We use the resulting projections to derive a baseline expected rate of return for the Cash Balance Plan’s prescribed asset mix.\n",
      "Mortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables published by the Society of Actuaries adjusted to reflect our specific experience.\n",
      "At year end, we re-measure our defined benefit plan liabilities and related plan assets and recognize any resulting actuarial gain or loss in OCI. We generally amortize net actuarial gain or loss in excess of a 5% corridor from AOCI into net periodic pension cost over the estimated average remaining participation period, which at December 31, 2022, is 18 years. See Note 21 (Employee Benefits) for additional information on our pension accounting.\n",
      "Income Taxes We file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we operate and evaluate income tax expense in two components: current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits.\n",
      "Deferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet method and deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the realizable amount. See Note 22 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this Report for a further description of our provision for income taxes and related income tax assets and liabilities.\n",
      "PSAs and certain RSRs granted in 2020 included\n",
      "discretionary conditions that can result in forfeiture and are measured at fair value initially and subsequently until the discretionary conditions end. For these awards, the associated compensation expense fluctuates with changes in our stock price. Awards granted in 2022 and 2021 no longer included these discretionary conditions and are not adjusted for subsequent changes in stock price. For PSAs, compensation expense also fluctuates based on the estimated outcome of meeting the performance conditions. The total expense that will be recognized on these awards is finalized upon the completion of the performance period.\n",
      "For additional information on our stock-based employee compensation plans, see Note 12 (Common Stock and Stock Plans).\n",
      "Earnings Per Common Share We compute earnings per common share by dividing net income applicable to common stock (net income less dividends on preferred stock and the excess of consideration transferred over carrying value of preferred stock redeemed, if any) by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted earnings per common share using net income applicable to common stock and adding the effect of common stock equivalents (e.g., restricted share rights) that are dilutive to the average number of common shares outstanding during the period.\n",
      "Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on an exit price notion that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs.\n",
      "We measure our assets and liabilities at fair value when we are required to record them at fair value, when we have elected the fair value option, and to fulfill fair value disclosure requirements. Assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis require a fair value measurement at each reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are adjusted to fair value only as required through the application of an accounting method such as LOCOM, write-downs of individual assets, or application of the measurement alternative for certain nonmarketable equity securities.\n",

Observable market data includes but is not limited to quoted prices and market transactions. Changes in economic conditions or market liquidity generally will drive changes in availability of observable market data. Changes in availability of observable market data, which also may result in changing the valuation technique used, are generally the cause of transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.

If an AVM is not available, then the value is estimated using the original appraised value adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the property location. If an HPI is not available, the original appraised value is used. The HPI value is normally the only method considered for high value properties, generally with an original value of $1 million or more, as the AVM values have proven less accurate for these properties. Generally, we obtain available LTVs and CLTVs on a quarterly basis. Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV due to a lack of industry data availability and portfolios acquired from or serviced by other institutions.\n",

The consent orders require remediation to customers and the payment of a total of $1.0 billion in civil money penalties to the agencies. In July 2017, the Company announced a plan to remediate customers who may have been financially harmed due to issues related to automobile CPI policies purchased through a third-party vendor on their behalf.

Shareholders also filed a putative securities fraud class action against the Company and its executive officers alleging material misstatements and omissions of CPI-related information in the Company’s public disclosures. In January 2020, the court dismissed this action as to all defendants except the Company and a former executive officer and limited the action to two alleged misstatements. Subject to court approval, the parties have entered into an agreement pursuant to which the Company will pay $300 million to resolve this action.

Visa, MasterCard, and several other banks and bank holding companies are also named as defendants in these actions. These actions have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The amended and consolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants based on alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and seeks damages as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege that Visa, MasterCard, and payment card issuing banks unlawfully colluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that enforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged tying and bundling of services offered to merchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along with other defendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment Sharing Agreements, which provide that they, along with other entities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses from the Interchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and the financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, signed a memorandum of understanding with plaintiff merchants to resolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate settlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions. The settlement payments to be made by all defendants in the consolidated class and individual actions totaled approximately $6.6 billion before reductions applicable to certain merchants opting out of the settlement. The class settlement also provided for the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period of eight consecutive months.

On November 30, 2016, the district court appointed lead class counsel for a damages class and an equitable relief class. The parties have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the money damages class claims pursuant to which defendants will pay a total of approximately $6.2 billion, which includes approximately $5.3 billion of funds remaining from the 2012 settlement and $900 million in additional funding.

      "OUTLOOK As described above, the Company establishes accruals for legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and estimable losses was approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against Wells Fargo and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s consolidated financial condition. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material to Wells Fargo’s results of operations for any particular period.\n",

      "We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. We designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (fair value or cash flow hedges). Our remaining derivatives consist of economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting and derivatives held for customer accommodation trading or other purposes.\n",
      "Risk Management Derivatives Our asset/liability management approach to interest rate, foreign currency and certain other risks includes the use of derivatives, which are typically designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, or economic hedges. We use derivatives to help minimize significant, unplanned fluctuations in earnings, fair values of assets and liabilities, and cash flows caused by interest rate, foreign currency and other market risk volatility. This approach involves modifying the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates, foreign currency and other exposures, which may cause the hedged assets and liabilities to gain or lose fair value, do not have a significant adverse effect on the net interest margin, cash flows and earnings. In a fair value or economic hedge, the effect of change in fair value will generally be offset by the unrealized gain or loss on the derivatives linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. In a cash flow hedge, where we manage the variability of cash payments due to interest rate or foreign currency fluctuations by the effective use of derivatives linked to hedged assets and liabilities, the hedged asset or liability is not adjusted and the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income.\n",

These derivative transactions, which involve engaging in market-making activities or acting as an intermediary, are conducted in an effort to help customers manage their market risks. We usually offset our exposure from such derivatives by entering into other financial contracts, such as separate derivative or security transactions. These customer accommodations and any offsetting derivatives are treated as customer accommodation trading and other derivatives in our disclosures. Additionally, embedded derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately from their host contracts are included in the customer accommodation trading and other derivatives disclosures, as applicable.\n",

Additionally, from time to time, we record fair value adjustments on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or fair value (LOCOM) accounting, write-downs of individual assets or application of the measurement alternative for nonmarketable equity securities. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are presented in Table 15.4 in this Note. We provide in Table 15.9 estimates of fair value for financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, such as loans and debt liabilities carried at amortized cost.\n",
      "AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES AFS debt securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement for AFS debt securities is based upon various sources of market pricing. Where available, we use quoted prices in active markets. When instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted prices in active markets do not exist for such securities, we use prices obtained from third-party pricing services and, to a lesser extent, may use prices obtained from independent broker-dealers (brokers), collectively vendor prices. Substantially all of our AFS debt securities are recorded using vendor prices. See the “Level 3 Asset and Liability Valuation Processes – Vendor Developed Valuations” section in this Note for additional discussion of our processes when using vendor prices to record fair value of AFS debt securities, which includes those classified as Level 2 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.\n",
      "FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY We classify our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on significant unobservable inputs. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in this Report for a detailed description of the fair value hierarchy.\n",
      "In the determination of the classification of financial instruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. This determination is ultimately based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of the unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. We do not classify nonmarketable equity securities in the fair value hierarchy if we use the non-published net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to measure fair value. Marketable equity securities with published NAVs are classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n",
      "When vendor prices are deemed inappropriate, they may be adjusted based on other market data or internal models. We also use internal models when no vendor prices are available. Internal models use discounted cash flow techniques or market comparable pricing techniques.\n",
      "LOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS) LHFS generally includes commercial and residential mortgage loans originated for sale in the securitization or whole loan market. A majority of residential LHFS, and our portfolio of commercial LHFS in our trading business, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The remaining LHFS are held at LOCOM which may be written down to fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value for LHFS that are not part of our trading business is based on quoted market prices, where available, or the prices for other mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics. We may use securitization prices that are adjusted for typical securitization activities including servicing value, portfolio composition, market conditions and liquidity. Fair value for LHFS in our trading business is based on pending transactions when available. Where market pricing data or pending transactions are not available, we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value.\n",
      "Assets TRADING DEBT SECURITIES Trading debt securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. These securities are valued using internal trader prices that are subject to independent price verification procedures, which includes comparing internal trader prices against multiple independent pricing sources, such as prices obtained from third-party pricing services, observed trades, and other approved market data. These pricing services compile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing for similar securities when no price is observable. We review pricing methodologies provided by pricing services to determine if observable market information is being used versus unobservable inputs. When evaluating the appropriateness of an internal trader price, compared with other independent pricing sources, considerations include the range and quality of available information and observability of trade data. These sources are used to evaluate the reasonableness of a trader price; however, valuing financial instruments involves judgments acquired from knowledge of a particular market. Substantially all of our trading debt securities are recorded using internal trader prices.\n",
      "LOANS Although loans are recorded at amortized cost, we record nonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect write-downs that are based on the observable market price of the loan or current appraised value of the collateral less costs to sell.\n",
      "MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRs) Residential MSRs are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. Commercial MSRs are carried at LOCOM and may be written down to fair value on a nonrecurring basis. MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. We determine the fair value of MSRs using a valuation model that estimates the present value of expected future net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants may use in estimating future net servicing income cash flows, including estimates of prepayment speeds (including housing price volatility for residential MSRs), discount rates, default rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees.\n",

Valuation techniques a nd inputs to internal models depend on the type of derivative and nature of the underlying rate, price or index upon which the va of the derivative is based.

      "EQUITY SECURITIES Marketable equity securities and certain nonmarketable equity securities that we have elected to account for at fair value are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Our remaining nonmarketable equity securities are accounted for using the equity method, cost method or measurement alternative and can be subject to nonrecurring fair value adjustments to record impairment. Additionally, the carrying value of equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative is also remeasured to fair value upon the occurrence of orderly observable transactions of the same or similar securities of the same issuer.\n",
      "We use quoted prices to determine the fair value of\n",
      "marketable equity securities, as the securities are publicly traded. Quoted prices are typically not available for nonmarketable equity securities. We therefore use other methods, generally market comparable pricing techniques, to determine fair value for such securities. We use all available information in making this determination, which includes observable transaction prices for the same or similar security, prices from third-party pricing services, broker quotes, trading multiples of comparable public companies, and discounted cash flow models. Where appropriate, we make adjustments to observed market data to reflect the comparative differences between the market data and the attributes of our equity security, such as differences with public companies and other investment-specific considerations like liquidity, marketability or differences in terms of the instruments.\n",

      "Level 3 Asset and Liability Valuation Processes We generally determine fair value of our Level 3 assets and liabilities by using internal models and, to a lesser extent, prices obtained from vendors. Our valuation processes vary depending on which approach is utilized.\n",
      "INTERNAL MODEL VALUATIONS Certain Level 3 fair value estimates are based on internal models, such as discounted cash flow or market comparable pricing techniques. Some of the inputs used in these valuations are unobservable. Unobservable inputs are generally derived from or can be correlated to historic performance of similar portfolios or previous market trades in similar instruments where particular unobservable inputs may be implied. We attempt to correlate each unobservable input to historical experience and other third-party data where available. Internal models are subject to review prescribed within our model risk management policies and procedures, which include model validation. Model validation helps ensure our models are appropriate for their intended use and appropriate controls exist to help mitigate risk of invalid valuations. Model validation assesses the adequacy and appropriateness of our models, including reviewing its key components, such as inputs, processing components, logic or theory, output results and supporting model documentation. Validation also includes ensuring significant unobservable model inputs are appropriate given observable market transactions or other market data within the same or similar asset classes. We also have ongoing monitoring procedures in place for our Level 3 assets and liabilities that use internal valuation models. These procedures, which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that models continue to perform as expected, include: •\n",
      "• • ongoing analysis and benchmarking to market transactions and other independent market data (including pricing vendors, if available); back-testing of modeled fair values to actual realized transactions; and review of modeled valuation results against expectations, including review of significant or unusual fluctuations in value.\n",
      "OTHER ASSETS Although other assets are generally recorded at amortized cost, we record nonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect impairments or the impact of certain lease modifications. Other assets subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements include operating lease ROU assets, foreclosed assets and physical commodities. Fair value is generally based upon independent market prices or appraised values less costs to sell, or the use of a discounted cash flow model.\n",
      "Liabilities SHORT-SALE TRADING LIABILITIES Short-sale trading liabilities in our trading business are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and are measured using quoted prices in active markets, where available. When quoted prices for the same instruments are not available or markets are not active, fair values are estimated using recent trades of similar securities.\n",
      "We update model inputs and methodologies periodically to reflect these monitoring procedures. Additionally, existing models are subject to periodic reviews and we perform full model revalidations as necessary.\n",
      "Internal valuation models are subject to ongoing review by the appropriate principal line of business or enterprise function and monitoring oversight by Independent Risk Management. Independent Risk Management, through its Model Risk function, provides independent oversight of model risk management, and its responsibilities include governance, validation, periodic review, and monitoring of model risk across the Company and providing periodic reports to management and the Board’s Risk Committee.\n",
      "LONG-TERM DEBT Although long-term debt is generally recorded at amortized cost, we have elected the fair value option for certain structured notes issued by our trading business.

      "and liabilities, as presented in Table 15.3, are described as follows: • Discounted cash flow techniques generally consist of developing an estimate of future cash flows that are expected to occur over the life of an instrument and then discounting those cash flows at a rate of return that results in the fair value amount. – Discounted cash flow valuation • Market comparable pricing – Market comparable pricing • valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of certain instruments by incorporating known inputs, such as recent transaction prices, pending transactions, financial metrics of comparable companies, or prices of other similar investments that require significant adjustment to reflect differences in instrument characteristics. Option model – Option model valuation techniques are generally used for instruments in which the holder has a contingent right or obligation based on the occurrence of a future event, such as the price of a referenced asset going above or below a predetermined strike price. Option models estimate the likelihood of the specified event occurring by incorporating assumptions such as volatility estimates, price of the underlying instrument and expected rate of return. The unobservable inputs presented in the previous tables are those we consider significant to the fair value of the Level 3 asset or liability. We consider unobservable inputs to be significant if by their exclusion the fair value of the Level 3 asset or liability would be impacted by a predetermined percentage change. We also consider qualitative factors, such as nature of the instrument, type of valuation technique used, and the significance of the unobservable inputs relative to other inputs used within the valuation. Following is a description of the significant unobservable inputs provided in the table. • • • • • • Comparability adjustment observed market data, such as a transaction price to reflect dissimilarities in underlying collateral, issuer, rating, or ot her factors used within a market valuation approach, expressed as a percentage of an observed price.

Correlation factor changing in price relative to another based on an established relationship expressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a period over time. Cost to service portfolio of loans, which includes estimates for unreimbursed expenses (including delinquency and foreclosure costs) that may occur as a result of servicing such loan portfolios. Default rate – is an estimate of the likelihood of not collecting contractual amounts owed expressed as a constant default rate (CDR). Discount rate present value of the future expected cash flow to arrive at the fair value of an instrument. The discount rate consists of a benchmark rate component and a risk premium component. The benchmark rate component, for example, OIS, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or U.S. Treasury rates, is generally observable within the market and is necessary to appropriately reflect the time value of money.

Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input.

      "Involvement with Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability companies or partnerships that are established for a limited purpose. SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization transactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. SPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are generally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE may alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative transactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various forms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer financial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in connection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and sometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets we transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the right to service the transferred assets and repurchase the transferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls below the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the benefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans transferred to a VIE by a third party.\n",
      "In connection with our securitization or other VIE activities, we have various forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which may include: •\n",
      "underwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently making markets in those securities; providing credit enhancement on securities issued by VIEs through the use of letters of credit or financial guarantees; entering into other derivative contracts with VIEs; holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs; acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs; providing administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and providing seller financing to VIEs.\n",
      "Loan Sales and Securitization Activity We periodically transfer consumer and commercial loans and other types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan sale transactions.\n",
      "MORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE In the normal course of business we sell originated and purchased residential and commercial mortgage loans to government-sponsored entities (GSEs). These loans are generally transferred into securitizations sponsored by the GSEs, which provide certain credit guarantees to investors and servicers. We also transfer mortgage loans into securitization pools pursuant to Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) guidelines which are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Mortgage loans eligible for securitization with the GSEs or GNMA are considered conforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA design the structure of these securitizations, sponsor the involved VIEs, and have power over the activities most significant to the VIE.\n",
      "We account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage loan securitization transactions as sales and do not consolidate the VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In exchange for the transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the VIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment purposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing rights on the transferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option\n",
      "to repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which becomes exercisable when three scheduled loan payments remain unpaid by the borrower. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we repurchased loans of $2.2 billion, $4.6 billion, and $30.3 billion, respectively, which predominantly represented repurchases of government insured loans. We recorded assets and related liabilities of $743 million and $107 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, where we did not exercise our option to repurchase eligible loans. Upon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for\n",
      "losses incurred due to material breaches of contractual representations and warranties as well as other recourse arrangements. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our liability for these repurchase and recourse arrangements was $167 million and $173 million, respectively, and the maximum exposure to loss was $13.8 billion and $13.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n",
      "Substantially all residential servicing activity is related to assets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about residential and commercial servicing rights, advances and servicing fees.\n",
      "NONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS In the normal course of business, we sell nonconforming residential and commercial mortgage loans in securitization transactions that we design and sponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations do not involve a government credit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest holders are subject to credit risk of the underlying assets held by the securitization VIE. We typically originate the transferred loans, account for the transfers as sales and do not consolidate the VIE. We also typically retain the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial interests issued by the VIEs, such as debt securities held for investment purposes. Our servicing role related to nonconforming commercial mortgage loan securitizations is limited to primary or master servicer and the most significant decisions impacting the performance of the VIE are generally made by the special servicer or the controlling class security holder. For our residential nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations accounted for as sales, we either do not hold variable interests that we consider potentially significant or are not the primary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets.\n",
      "WHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We also sell whole loans to VIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of financing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs.\n",
      "Table 16.1 presents information about transfers of assets during the periods presented for which we recorded the transfers as sales and have continuing involvement with the transferred assets. In connection with these transfers, we received proceeds and recorded servicing assets, securities, and loans. Each of these interests are initially measured at fair value. Servicing rights are classified as Level 3 measurements, and generally securities are classified as Level 2. Substantially all transfers were related to residential mortgage securitizations with the GSEs or GNMA and resulted in no gain or loss because the loans are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, we may transfer certain government insured loans that we previously repurchased. These\n",

      "RESECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES We enter into resecuritization transactions as part of our trading activities to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers. In resecuritization transactions, we transfer trading debt securities to VIEs in exchange for new beneficial interests that are sold to third parties at or shortly after securitization settlement. This activity is performed for customers seeking a specific return or risk profile. Substantially all of our transactions involve the resecuritization of conforming mortgage-backed securities issued by the GSEs or guaranteed by GNMA. We do not consolidate the resecuritization VIEs as we share in the decision- making power with third parties and do not hold significant economic interests in the VIEs other than for market-making activities. We transferred $17.0 billion, $39.6 billion, and $77.2 billion of securities to resecuritization VIEs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

In connection with the sales, we provided $3.8 billion of collateralized loan financing to a third- party sponsored VIE, and received cash flows of $3.8 billion which fully repaid these loans.

      "WRITTEN OPTIONS We enter into written foreign currency options and over-the-counter written equity put options that are derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee. Written put options give the counterparty the right to sell to us an underlying instrument held by the counterparty at a specified price by a specified date. While these derivative transactions expose us to risk if the option is exercised, we manage this risk by entering into offsetting trades or by taking short positions in the underlying instrument. We offset market risk related to options written to customers with cash securities or other offsetting derivative transactions. Additionally, for certain of these contracts, we require the counterparty to pledge the underlying instrument as collateral for the transaction. Our ultimate obligation under written options is based on future market conditions and is only quantifiable at settlement. The fair value of written options represents our view of the probability that we will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value of these written options was a liability of $15 million, and an asset of $280 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value may be an asset as a result of deferred premiums on certain option trades. The maximum exposure to loss represents the notional value of these derivative contracts. At December 31, 2022, the maximum exposure to loss was $23.4 billion, with $21.3 billion expiring in three years or less compared with $17.2 billion and $16.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021.

      "LOANS AND LHFS SOLD WITH RECOURSE In certain sales and securitizations of loans, including mortgage loans, we provide recourse to the buyer whereby we are required to indemnify the buyer for any loss on the loan up to par value plus accrued interest. We provide recourse, predominantly to GSEs, on loans sold under various programs and arrangements. Substantially all of these programs and arrangements require that we share in the loans’ credit exposure for their remaining life by providing recourse to the GSE, up to 33.33% of actual losses incurred on a pro-rata basis in the event of borrower default. Under the remaining recourse programs and arrangements, if certain events occur within a specified period of time from transfer date, we have to provide limited recourse to the buyer to indemnify them for losses incurred for the remaining life of the loans. The maximum exposure to loss reported in Table 17.1 represents the outstanding principal balance of the loans sold or securitized that are subject to recourse provisions or the maximum losses per the contractual agreements. However, we believe the likelihood of loss of the entire balance due to these recourse agreements is remote, and amounts paid can be recovered in whole or in part from the sale of collateral. We also provide representation and warranty guarantees on loans sold under the various recourse programs and arrangements. Our loss exposure relative to these guarantees is separately considered and provided for, as necessary, in determination of our liability for loan repurchases due to breaches of representation and warranties.\n",
      "EXCHANGE AND CLEARING HOUSE GUARANTEES We are members of several securities and derivatives exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and in countries outside the U.S., that we use to clear our trades and those of our customers. It is common that all members in these organizations are required to collectively guarantee the performance of other members and of the organization. Our obligations under the guarantees are generally a pro-rata share based on either a fixed amount or a multiple of the guarantee fund we are required to maintain with these organizations. Some membership rules require members to assume a pro-rata share of losses resulting from another member’s default or from non-member default losses after applying the guarantee fund. We have not recorded a liability for these arrangements as of the dates presented in Table 17.1 because we believe the likelihood of loss is remote.\n",

      "MERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and credit card transaction processing services through payment networks directly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing servicers, including our joint venture with a third party that is accounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the merchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in connection with payment and delivery disputes between the merchant and the cardholder that are resolved in favor of the cardholder, referred to as a charge-back transaction. If we are unable to collect the amounts from the merchant, we incur a loss for the refund to the cardholder. We are secondarily obligated to make a refund for transactions involving sponsored merchant processing servicers. We generally have a low likelihood of loss in connection with our merchant processing services because most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are generally refunded when items are returned to the merchant. In addition, we may reduce our risk in connection with these transactions by withholding future payments and requiring cash or other collateral. We estimate our potential maximum exposure to be the total merchant transaction volume processed in the preceding four months, which is generally the lifecycle for a charge-back transaction. As of December 31, 2022, our potential maximum exposure was approximately $759.6 billion, and related losses, including those from our joint venture entity, were insignificant.\n",
      "GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES In the normal course of business, the Parent may provide counterparties with guarantees related to its subsidiaries’ obligations. These obligations are included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments, and therefore, the Parent has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Parent fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment of principal, interest, and any other amounts that may be due on securities that its 100% owned finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo Finance LLC, may issue. These securities are not guaranteed by any other subsidiary of the Parent. The guaranteed liabilities were $948 million and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These guarantees rank on parity with all of the Parent’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The assets of the Parent consist primarily of equity in its subsidiaries, and the Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. As a result, the Parent’s ability to address claims of holders of these debt securities against the Parent under the guarantee depends on the Parent’s receipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds from its subsidiaries. If any of the Parent’s subsidiaries becomes insolvent, the direct creditors of that subsidiary will have a prior claim on that subsidiary’s assets. The rights of the Parent and the rights of the Parent’s creditors will be subject to that prior claim unless the Parent is also a direct creditor of that subsidiary.

      "As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s ACL as of December 31, 2022 was $13.6 billion. The ACL includes the measurement of expected credit losses on a collective basis for those loans that share similar risk characteristics utilizing multiple credit loss models. The Company estimated the ACL for commercial loans by applying probability of default and severity of loss estimates to an expected exposure at default. The probability of default and severity of loss estimates are statistically derived through historical observations of default and losses after default for each credit risk rating. The Company estimated the ACL for consumer loans utilizing credit loss models which estimate expected credit losses in the portfolio based on individual risk characteristics of the loans and historical experience of probability of default and severity of loss estimates. The Company’s credit loss models utilize economic variables, including economic assumptions forecast over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The Company forecasts multiple economic scenarios and applies weighting to the scenarios that are used to estimate expected credit losses. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts over the reversion period to the long-term average for the forecasted economic variables based on historical observations over multiple economic cycles. A portion of the ACL is comprised of adjustments for qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models.\n",
      "We identified the assessment of the ACL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the ACL. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the ACL methodology for collectively evaluated loans, including the methods and models used to estimate (1) probability of default and severity of loss estimates, significant economic assumptions, the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the historical observation period, and credit risk ratings for commercial loans, and (2) the adjustments for qualitative factors that may not be adequately captured in the loss models.

The Company uses a valuation model for determining fair value that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income cash flows, which incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income cash flows. These assumptions include estimates of prepayment rates (including estimated borrower defaults), discount rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. The estimated fair value of MSRs is periodically benchmarked to independent appraisals.\n",
      "We identified the assessment of the valuation of residential MSRs as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the MSRs. Specifically, there was a high degree of subjectivity used to evaluate the following assumptions because they are unobservable and the sensitivity of changes to those assumptions had a significant effect on the valuation (1) prepayment rates, (2) discount rates, and (3) cost to service. There was also a high degree of subjectivity and potential for management bias related to updates made to significant assumptions due to changes in market conditions, mortgage interest rates, or servicing standards.\n",

      "\n",
      "We evaluated the Company’s process to develop the MSR fair value by testing certain sources of data and assumptions that the Company used and considered the relevance and reliability of such data and assumptions. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n",

      "Assessment of goodwill impairment\n",
      "As discussed in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance as of December 31, 2022 was $25.2 billion. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired, by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Management estimates the fair value of its reporting units using an income approach and a market approach. The income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis that incorporates assumptions including financial forecasts, a terminal value based on an assumed long-term growth rate, and a discount rate. The financial forecasts include future expectations of economic conditions and balance sheet changes, and considerations related to future business activities. The forecasted cash flows are discounted using a rate derived from a capital asset pricing model which produces an estimated cost of equity to the reporting unit. The market approach utilizes observable market data from comparable publicly traded companies and incorporates assumptions including the selection of comparable companies and a control premium representative of management’s expectation of a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit.\n",
      "We identified the assessment of the goodwill impairment for the Consumer Lending reporting unit, which had $7.1 billion of allocated goodwill as of December 31, 2022, as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of certain assumptions used in the DCF analysis to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit, including (1) the future expectations of balance sheet changes and business activities used in the financial forecast and (2) the discount rate.\n",
      "The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s determination of the estimated fair value of the Consumer Lending reporting unit, including controls related to the:\n",
      "evaluation of the future expectations of balance sheet changes and business activities used in the financial forecast assumption and evaluation of the discount rate assumption.\n",
      "We evaluated the reasonableness of the financial forecast assumption for the reporting unit by evaluating historical performance and economic trends. We also evaluated the consistency of the financial forecast assumption by comparing the forecast to other analyses used by the Company and inquiries performed of senior management regarding the strategic plans for the reporting unit, including future expectations of balance sheet changes and business activities. We compared historical financial forecasts to actual results to assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast. In addition, we involved a valuation professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n",
